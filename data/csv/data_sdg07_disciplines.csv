To meet these demands, mankind is highly dependent on burning fossils and petroleum, which release greenhouse gases leading to global warming. Therefore, it has become crucial to find alternative renewable energy sources. Arguably, the sun is one of the greenest yet abundant sources of energy as the solar energy that earth receives in a day is more than sufficient to meet our energy consumption demands for an entire year. Alternatively, the energy consumption rate can be decreased by developing efficient light emitting devices, as the common use of white light emitting devices can save approx. 40% of electrical energy in 2030, and will also control the emission of > 100 million tons of CO2. However, the fabrication of commercial solar cells and lighting devices demands expensive deposition approaches. I propose to investigate new light absorbers and light emitters, which are benign in nature and exhibit immunity towards ambient conditions. The proposed trivalent metal based perovskites exhibiting enticing photostability and optoelectronic properties will be processed using facile, scalable, and economic solution-based bottom-up approaches. Based on the detailed structural, compositional, morphological, and spectroscopic analyses, the best strategies and desired compositions will be used for the fabrication of efficient solar cells and light emitting devices. We strongly believe that the solar cells and light emitting devices based on these materials will have a significant prospect for the practical applications and large-scale fabrication.; Solar Energy; Solar cells; Light emitting devices; Lead-free perovskites; Semiconductors; Light absorber; Light emitter; Renewable Energy",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

These global issues have considerably pushed the development of green technologies and led to an exponential interest in bio-based materials from renewable natural sources. Cellulose (the most abundant organic polymer on the planet) is a chemical raw material which has been used for thousands of years, but it is only in the last few decades that nanocellulose (nano-sized cellulose particles isolated directly from the biomass) has been investigated for applications in biopolymer composites with improved mechanical properties. The combination of the excellent mechanical properties of nanocellulose with natural abundance, low production cost, and biodegradability makes cellulose-based nanocomposites an attractive and promising green approach to cope with the environmental concerns of society. If nanocellulose is going to make an impact in the composites world then simple, cost-effective melt processing techniques need to be developed. This project proposes a green and cheap functionalization of the surface hydroxyl group of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) using dynamic covalent chemistry under melt processing conditions. The concept involves melt processing of the CNCs with a dynamic polymer matrix, which during thermal processing releases reactive functional moieties that react with the hydroxyl motifs on the CNC surface. For example, bulky urea functional groups are known to cleave into a secondary amine and isocyanate moiety at elevated temperatures (the temperature required depends on the steric hindrance of the secondary amine), the latter can subsequently functionalize the CNCs. Such functionalization of the CNC with the polymers will allow direct access to homogenous composite materials with a better mechanical property profile. This proposal is built in three consecutive parts; I) preliminary fundamental investigations on temperature-induced functionalization of CNCs with mono-functional hindered urea molecule or polymers, II) study and development of an in situ CNC functionalization in a hot-melt process with renewable polyurethanes, III) extension of the temperature-induced CNC functionalization approach to other dynamic bonds. Along the study, rigorous surface characterizations of the grafted CNCs will provide a deep understanding on the dynamic process and establish key parameters for an efficient functionalization under the melt processing. These factors will then allow the development of efficient engineering processes to achieve an optimal reinforcement effect. In addition, the processing improvement will demonstrate the potential for a large-scale production that can be accomplished using this strategy. This facile, low cost and industrially scalable green approach will drastically contribute to the development of biodegradable composite materials from renewable sources with advanced performance and functionalities.; hot-melt processing; dynamic; hindered urea; Cellulose nanocrystals; renewable sources",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

One reason for inertia is that those bearing the costs of energy system change-e.g., actors representing incumbent fossil fuel interests-employ a wide range of strategies to countervail or water down measures aimed at fostering change. Whereas stakeholders’ organizational activities to shape public opinion are relatively well documented and understood, little systematic knowledge has accrued so far on the extent to which stakeholders’ communication efforts do actually influence citizens' preferences. With this proposal, I suggest to investigate citizens' preferences related to energy policies and how they are influenced by stakeholders’ communication activities. Drawing from Behavioral (Political) Science and Cognitive Psychology, the research questions focus on the effectiveness of both framing effects and source cue effects. Frames, as the formulation of decision problems, have been shown to be an important preference-shaping factor, but research has just started to take real-world scenarios of competitive framing into account, and little is known about the dynamics of framing effects in relation to energy policy. Source cues, as the political actors behind an issue, can be seen as powerful heuristics enabling voters to make decisions with marginal efforts. To date, little is known about the extent to which stakeholders (such as organized interests) matter as source cues, and whether source cues are as important as frames in shaping preferences. Moreover, this project inquires into the role of voters’ ideological predispositions and their political competence in explaining preference formation.Methodologically, preference formation will be examined with a mix of observational data based on panel studies and experiments. For my stay at Princeton University, I propose to conduct two experiments, both of which focus on intended vote choice on a hypothetical policy as the dependent variable. Study 1, a lab experiment (n = 350), investigates the interplay of frames and source cues over time. Study 2, a survey experiment with an embedded choice-based conjoint task (n = 1`000, recruitment with MTurk), assesses the role of gain and loss frames, counterframes, and citizens’ preferences for specific design features of energy policies.In terms of the concrete field of application, the planned project for my stay in Princeton will be the first that systematically examines citizens’ preferences towards policies for a phase out of fossil fuels for electricity generation. It thus responds to the need outlined by climate scientists and international climate policy negotiators to assess the prospects for phasing out these traditional technologies.The project will derive implications for the literature on (environmental) decision making as well as the policy literature and policy practitioners. A better understanding of the factors that shape preferences about energy policies is quintessential to enable a democratically steered transition towards sustainable energy systems, and the findings are expected to yield insights into the question how societies can manage the transition towards more sustainable energy systems. The scientific dialogue and cooperation with my supervisor Prof. Elke Weber and other researchers at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University will allow me to keep abreast of the newest insights from research on environmental decision making. Integrating these insights into my research project will help me to further improve the theoretical basis and relevance of my research project and to increase the chances of publication of the research findings in a high-quality scientific journal.; Environmental Decision Making; Energy Policy; Citizen Preferences; Source Cue Effects; Issue Framing; Political Communication",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,10600,10500,NA,NA,NA,NA
179921,07,Ambizione,2018,ETH Domain,Electrical Engineering,Engineering Sciences,Careers,592578,TRUE,Energy Efficient Cryptography,Low Energy; Lightweight Cryptography,"In the past few years, lightweight cryptography has become a popular research discipline with a number of ciphers and hash functions proposed. The optimization goal of low energy for cryptographic designs has been addressed in a relatively small number of papers. Energy is a crucial measure of goodness for an algorithm. Indeed, any construction optimized with respect to energy has wide applications, especially in constrained environments running on a tight power/energy budget. In this project, we intend to address this gap that has existed in literature for some time now. There is a dearth of symmetric key cryptographic primitives catered specifically towards low energy consumption. The only encryption solution catered to address the question of low energy was the block cipher Midori. This leaves open a vast spectrum of cryptographic primitives where energy efficient solutions have not been explored by the community as of yet. The main goal of this project is to research this unexplored design space. The main objectives of the project are twofold: 1 Explore energy efficient implementations of existing standardized primitives like AES-128, SHA-3.2 Study techniques to design dedicated primitives for the following cryptographic tasks:  a) Encryption,   b) Message Authentication,  c) Hash function, and  d) Authenticated Encryption system.  Stream ciphers can prove to be excellent tools for constructing low energy designs. It has been found out that for encrypting long data streams, stream cipher like Trivium consumes around 9 times less energy than the best block cipher based encryption schemes. Trivium consists of a 3 part shift register with a simple boolean function based round update. This structure offers numerous benefits with respect to power consumption, and is easy to modify to obtain larger throughput i.e. number of output bytes produced per clock cycle. Thus, using such structures to design the primitives listed above is expected to result in lower energy consumption. The importance of low energy solutions to cryptographic schemes is hard to overestimate. It is expected that over 50 billion devices will be connected into an Internet of Things by 2020. With billions of small, battery powered devices generating a large part of data traffic, energy becomes a critical parameter for optimization. The upcoming NIST Profiles for the Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Process  specifies energy as one of the key parameters that need to be optimized. As a result the work done in this project is expected to have a wide ranging impact on cryptography of the future. There is sufficient demand in the industry for low energy cryptographic designs and such ciphers will be extremely useful in applications like medical implants and passive RFID tags that run on low energy budget. ; Low Energy; Lightweight Cryptography",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20100,NA,NA,NA,NA

During my PhD thesis I have demonstrated DE actuators based on elastomer layers several hundred nanometers thin generating 6 % strain applying voltages as low as 12 V. However, to build artificial muscles thousands of nanostructures have to be stacked realizing the force comparable to natural muscles. Therefore, this Bridge-application will focus on the sensing capability of DETs. Currently available force and pressure sensors for medical applications fail to mimic the skin’s natural capabilities of force detecting due to rigidity and lack of biomimetic elastic properties. Geometrical restrictions limit their adaption to the given medical device. Moreover, the interplay of the electronic properties often lead either to low sensitivity, restricted response time or high power consumption. Robust and flexible sensors based on dielectric elastomer transducers (DETs) are operated at voltages below 1 V and offer the possibility for static/dynamic pressure sensing. Fabricated on soft polymer substrates they can be directly attached to the skin or implant surface for real-time monitoring with millisecond time response of diverse human physiological signals and body motions for wearable healthcare and patient rehabilitation. The capacitive sensor is based on multi-layered elastomer and metal films. Our unique thin-film technology reliably enables the fabrication of sub-micrometer thin elastomer and electrode films. When external pressures are applied, the induced deformation of the dielectric layer causes a change of capacitance. Sensitivities above 10 kPa-1 are adjusted to the physiological pressures of interest (Pa to MPa) by multilayered specifically tailored nanostructures. The high resting capacitance of hundreds of pF/cm2 enables simplified micro-electronics. Combined with the overall thickness below 100µm our dielectric elastomer sensors (DES) implies no geometrical restrictions to medical devices/implants. It’s low energy consumption below 1 nW combined with self-healing capabilities will enable long-term stable sensing solutions. In addition, sensor pads with spatial resolution of one sensor per mm2 can be cut individually by the customer or even surgeons adapted to the required individual shape of the patients implant. ; Dielectric elastomer sensor; Human machine interface; Smart medical device; Compliant metal/elastomer nanostructures; Nanometer-thin polymer films; Digitalized patient doctor interaction",1,0,Non-collaborative,4,1,More than one discipline,20400,20500,20300,30100,NA,NA

In addition, we will elucidate hydrogen absorption and desorption mechanism and suggest design guidelines aimed at practical hydrogen storage alloys.To accomplish the goal, we have assembled internationally recognized scientists with fundamental and practical research expertise and experience in collaboration between Japan and Switzerland. In this project, we focus on Mg based alloys with a Laves phase structure (we here refer to Mg based pseudo-Laves phase compounds) because 1) Mg is an abundant, cheap and a low density element and absorbs hydrogen with high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities (7.7 mass% and 109 kgH2/m3); and 2) Laves phase compounds exhibit hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction, of which temperature and pressure conditions can be adjusted by compositions of the compounds. The Mg based pseudo-Laves phase compounds will be synthesized in Japan. The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties will be investigated in Japan (isotherms) and Switzerland (isotherm and in-situ XRD) . Then, a Laves phase compound LaMg2 will be initially focused as basis of Mg based pseudo-Laves phase compounds because LaMg2 is one of the few Mg based Laves phase and absorb hydrogen (3.4 mass % and 120 kgH2/m3) at 100°C). Adjusting compositions of LaMg2 by addition of a third element such as transition and non-transition metals, the hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions conditions will be improved to reach =100°C and >0.1 MPa of hydrogen gas pressures. Mg based pseudo-Laves phase compounds and the hydrides will be characterized for their surface and crystal structures  by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and High Pressure and High Temperature powder X-ray (HPHT-XRD) and Neutron Diffraction (ND) for elucidation of hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we will examine cycling of hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions on Mg based pseudo-Laves phase in Japan and the cycled samples will be characterized by XPS, HPHT-XRD, synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and ND in Switzerland.

The energy storage market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, and with it the prospects for battery technologies in these stationary applications to complement existing pumped hydroelectric energy storage and power-to-gas / power-to-X concepts in storage applications on the 1-100 MW scale. Redox flow batteries, which comprise an electrochemical converter and an external tank to store the electrolytes containing redox-active species, are particularly attractive for stationary energy storage owing to the independent scalability of energy and power, their safe operation, long cycle-life and deep discharge capability. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRB) use vanadium-ions in different oxidation states as redox-active species in the two electrolytes, thus irreversible contamination of electrolytes by cross-mixing is avoided. In the current state of the art, the ion exchange membrane used as polymer electrolyte in the cell stack is responsible for about half of the hardware cost of a VRB system. This project aims at implementing a new membrane technology with significantly lower cost and improved performance compared to the perfluorinated membranes widely used today. This will, on the one hand, considerably reduce investment costs for VRB systems. On the other hand, a combination of lower ohmic resistance, lower vanadium crossover and cycling stability leads to superior efficiency of energy storage. The new membrane technology is based on current and ongoing developments at PSI based on the functionalization of pre-existing low-cost polymer films and porous substrates. PSI membranes with sulfonic acid and vanadium barrier motifs have shown superior energy efficiency and cycling stability compared to perfluorinated membranes at low to medium current density. Currently, new membrane architectures with a composite design are adopted to extend the operational regime to higher current densities of >150 mA·cm-2. The membrane design principles are of a generic nature and may lend themselves to adapting membrane materials to other types of redox flow cells. In the project, most promising membrane materials will be determined and developed into prototype membranes with technology readiness level (TRL) 4-5 to enable evaluation in relevant technical stack hardware at external partners. On the one hand, scale-up of membrane preparation will be done in-house at PSI, on the other hand options for off-site membrane fabrication, e.g. via sub-contracting, will be evaluated. The project roadmap envisions different routes for industrial implementation of the membrane technology, which are not mutually exclusive. The preferred option to enable such industrial implementation is the partnership with the German research institutes Bayrisches Zentrum für Angewandte Energieforschung (ZAE), TU München (TUM), and the Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT),. A pre-proposal for a joint project has been submitted to the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) in Germany, and this Bridge Discovery project is intended to fund the Swiss activities on membrane development in the framework of this overarching collaborative project. Contacts to other academic partners and industry may open up further opportunities for collaboration and implementation, e.g. via licensing of PSI membrane technology.  ; Redox flow battery; Cycling stability; Vanadium redox flow battery; Polymer electrolyte; Energy efficiency; Energy storage",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA
188588,07,Project funding,2019,ETH Domain,Condensed Matter Physics,Physics,Projects,361075,TRUE,Proton conductivity in epitaxial strained thin films,solid state electrochemistry; proton conductor; membrane; polaron; epitaxial strain; solid electrolyte,"Ceramic proton conductors can be used as solid electrolytes in intermediate temperature (around 350°C - 550°C) solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers (SOFC, SOEC). Their ionic conductivity is lower than conventional oxygen diffusion based electrolytes, which, however, operate at considerable higher temperatures (600°C - 900°C). Search for strategies to enhance proton conductivity at lower temperatures is therefore an ongoing quest. We found that the activation energy for proton transport in some proton conductors decreases when the crystallographic unit cell volume increases [Chen 2010, Duval 2008] - in contrast to findings in a computer simulation [Marx 2006]. These contrasting observations triggered our curiosity about the physical-chemical origin of the relationship between proton diffusivity and available lattice space. In a dedicated SNF project [Braun 2009], we then found that the proton conductivity originates from lattice dynamics based proton-phonon coupling with a Holstein-type polaron characteristic (awarded with the Swiss Neutron Society Young Investigator Award 2014 [Ronnow 2014]). This outcome resulted from experimental studies on “bulky” proton conductors where we parameterized specific observations by applying external compressive strain. Extrapolation from compressive to tensile strain, as we have suggested [Chen 2010] for epitaxial strained proton conductor films should have a low activation barrier at intermediate temperatures and maybe outperform contemporary proton conductor architectures. Our suggestion of higher proton conductivity in tensile strained films, which I submitted to the SNF two times in vain (200021_156099 April 2014 and 200021_159947 October 2014) remained speculation until recent experimental verification found by a group at PSI in Switzerland [Fluri 2017]. The purpose of this new proposal is therefore to extend the original “bulk” material to epitaxial strained films, and assess their structure and transport properties and solidify our proton polaron hypothesis [Braun 2017a]. This experimental research project aims at elucidating the effect of epitaxial strain on vibronic properties, lattice dynamics on the proton conductivity of thin film single crystal or highly oriented metal oxides relevant for energy applications, in particular with view of their application as membranes. We quantify the epitaxial strain of thin films and attempt to correlate it with proton transport and vibronic properties. We comprehend the structure-property relationship by looking at the electronic structure of the strained films with valence band photoemission spectroscopy and/or x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the oxygen K-edge, which probes the valence band. At best, we can parameterize Holstein’s polaron model with the strain parameter e. The requested funds are for the support of a project, which employs one postdoctoral researcher at Empa and supplements the expenses at the partners of the PIs in California and in Shanghai.Solid state ionic conductors play an important role in renewable energy storage and conversion. Efficient ionic conductivity in solids requires typically a high device operation temperature so as to overcome kinetic activation barriers. This projects aims at developing epitaxial thin film strategy in order to expand the crystal lattice of ceramic proton conductors so as to lower the proton transport activation energy and obtain, in the best case, a proton conductor which can operate at ambient temperature.We all know that electrons are charge carriers in electric devices. As same as important are the ionic charge carriers, which are the counterpart to electrons in batteries, fuel cells and electrolyzers. The ionic charge carriers move between the electrodes in the so-called electrolyte, which often is a liquid. One class of electrochemcial energy storage devices and energy converters uses solid electrolytes. One disadvantage of solid electrolytes is that they have a high resistance. The resistance only becomes lower when the temperature of the electrolyte is raised considerably, up to 1000°C.It is therefore of technological interest to find strategies to lower the operation temperature. Solid electroyltes are typically used in solid oxide fuel cells, where temperatures from 700°C to 1000°C are applied. In these, the ionic species which carries the current through the electrolyte is oxygen ions or oxygen vacancies. When protons are used as charge carriers, the operation temperature of the ceramic fuel cell, or electrolzyer, can be lowered to 450°C.It would be worthwhile to further lower the operation temperature so that no heat would be necessary to allow the fuel cell to work. We have recently shown in an SNF project that the activation energy barrier for proton transport in ceramic electrolyte membranes can be increased by compacting the proton conductor by external compressive strain.In this new project, we will try to apply tensile strain to the proton conductors to check whether the operation temperature for proton transport can be lowered. The technical trick to make this possible is based on epitaxial film technology, which is well-known in semiconductor technology.We want to be the first group to show that epitaxial strained films have a substantially lower activation energy than the corresponding bulk materials.; solid state electrochemistry; proton conductor; membrane; polaron; epitaxial strain; solid electrolyte",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20400,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result, the energy sector is undergoing significant changes, first, because PV is intermittent in nature, preventing it from supplying electricity on demand, and secondly, because the investments are made by consumers, leading to distributed electricity generation. Moreover, low-carbon technologies, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, are significantly increasing their share of electricity consumption in final demand, resulting in particularly sharp power peaks and a modified load profile.Ongoing experiences on the diffusion of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies have illustrated the key role of consumers for a successful energy transition. Consumers impact the instantaneous balance between electricity supply and demand, e.g., the duck curve in California, but also the electricity infrastructure and the business of other actors, such as utility companies. However, the various technological, economic, and social impacts of consumer preferences on technology diffusion and performance have barely been analysed to date, partly because this research requires a strong interdisciplinary approach. Such an approach and resulting findings are essential for steering the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050.Within Peer-to-Grid, we aim to examine consumer preferences for technologies and strategies to manage PV electricity and demand as well as their impact on technology diffusion in defined geographical areas. Moreover, we will determine the impact of preferences and diffusion on the grid infrastructure and other stakeholders such as utility companies and distribution system operators. Our hypotheses are: (i) consumers and utility companies have different preferences to manage PV electricity and demand, and (ii) their decisions do not always approach the social optimum, partly because there is no feedback on the macro impacts of their decisions. In particular, the project aims to address the following research objectives:1.Understanding the underpinnings of consumer preferences for PV systems and enabling technologies as well as strategies to manage PV electricity and demand.2.Predicting the diffusion of PV systems and enabling technologies based on assessed consumer data.3.Assessing the aggregated impacts of consumer preferences on the electricity grid infrastructure.4.Identifying policy interventions and win-win situations for consumers and utility companies, which stimulate the diffusion of PV and other low carbon technologies (e.g., batteries) at the minimal cost.Peer-to-Grid will make a timely contribution to both basic and applied research. We will apply agent-based modelling (ABM) with validation and geographical representation, using actual consumer preferences and historic PV penetration across rural and urban areas. We will then link ABM to a robust optimisation framework to anticipate grid infrastructure expansion, and to gain an understanding of policy interventions and business models, which boost PV deployment while minimising the impacts on the electricity grid. This interdisciplinary research is needed to address the pressing societal consequences of climate change and is thus prominent in top journals (e.g., Nature Energy) and grants (e.g., DOE in the USA and ERC in the EU).The applicants are well positioned across various SCCERs such as CREST and HaE.

Especially for conversion of sunlight to electricity/fuels, the photosynthetic processes in plants/microorganisms which optimized the light harvesting process for several billion years is being mimicked to develop photoelectrochemical devices, including dye-sensitized solar cells and water splitting systems. In the latter systems, the role of biological components are replaced by synthetic materials, but efforts were also being made to utilize natural components themselves in the devices. In solar cells, chromophores from photosystem I & II were employed as light absorbers. However, the stability of these bioextracts under illumination remain inferior compared to their living photosynthetic counterpart. So it is preferable to use living systems which can self-repair on photodamage and it is an attractive prospect for building low cost and stable solar energy conversion devices, in future. In spite of this potential, the state-of-the-art of  biophotovoltaic (BPV) or ‘living photovoltaic’ systems show power conversion efficiencies (PCE) below 0.1 % and is primarily due to the low short-circuit current density.  One of the key issues is the insulating outer layer of microbes that prevents the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers from the chromophore to the external circuit. In this proposal, we would like to address this specific issue in BPV to improve PCE. We are proposing a triangular approach wherein the problem will be addressed by the way of microbial engineering, electrochemical engineering and systems modelling, using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.  The microbial engineering approach will be focused on modifying the microbe’s metabolism to enhance the extracellular electron transfer to the photoanode and to minimize competing inherent mechanisms for dissipating excess energy. Direct extracellular electron transfer to the electrode will be achieved by the way of bioengineering exoelectrogenicity in the photosynthetic bacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. These bioengineered strains, along with the wildtype cells, will be electrochemically characterized to identify the possibility of indirect and possible direct extracellular electron transfer in the presence and absence of soluble mediators. The electrochemical approach, on other hand, will focus on identifying appropriate electron mediator to shuttle photogenerated electrons from the microbe to photoanode. The key to this task lies in finding the electrochemical potential of electrons at the point of extra cellular charge transfer. In the proposed work, electrochemistry of both wildtype cells and the bioengineered mutants will be investigated to identify the redox potential of the component that transfer the photogenerated to the external electron acceptor. Following the identification of potential, external redox mediators positive (w.r.t. to NHE) to the microbe will be selected and their efficacy in accepting charges will be investigated. Appropriate photoanode material that is selective to electron conduction and conduction band position that is positive to both the microbe and redox mediator will be identified. The goal of this part of the proposal is to find the right combination of microbe, redox mediator and anode, based on the redox potentials of each of these components. These components will be assembled into a biophotovoltaic devices based on a device architecture that is designed to avoid carrier recombination within the device, which decreases the overall conversion efficiency. The last in the triangular approach is the modelling & optimization of charge transfer within microbes and devices. The experimental charge transfer kinetics, in this biological network will be modelled to propose the optimized device design for high performance. All the parameters relevant to photocurrent generation starting from the absorption of solar photons to the electron extraction at the external contact will be simulated. Specifically, the quantum efficiency of photogenerated electrons from microbe to redox mediator, mass transport limitations redox mediator and charge carriers, parasitic recombination of electrons/holes and the catalytic ability of cathode for oxygen reduction, will be investigated in detail. Where ever available, experimental data will be used for the optimization. The feedback from the modelling will be used to decide further possibilities for improving the metabolic process in the biological medium and the device architecture, until an efficient biophotovoltaic device is obtained.  This combined approach is unique, wherein we bring in the three different expertise, i.e. microbial engineering, electrochemical engineering of biophotovoltaic devices and systems modelling, to develop high performing biophotovoltaic devices.; metabolic modelling; genetic engineering; biological photovoltaics; systems modelling",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,30100,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the large daily and seasonal power variation of renewable energy is a serious complication for a wide spread replacement of fossil energy by renewable energy. Thus the full potential of solar energy as a primary energy source can only be exploited, if we develop an efficient way of storing renewable energy, most preferably as a chemical fuel in the form of hydrogen or related compounds. In this project, we do not want to contribute to materials science in this research field directly, but rather to develop a novel measurement method being able to unravel the mechanisms driving the hydrogen - matter interaction taking place in hydrogen storage, hydrogen selective membranes, and the catalysis of hydrogenation reactions. Although apparently simple, a direct photoemission measurement of the hydrogen induced changes of the electronic structure, which are the origin of the binding of hydrogen with metals, is possible in a few cases only. The reason for this is purely technical: the electronic structure of hydrogen chemisorbed to surfaces can be measured using standard surface science techniques, because the required hydrogen pressure is compatible with the UHV-technology. However, processes relevant for energy conversion and storage take place at several atmospheres hydrogen pressure; and thus valuable information on these systems is not accessible by commonly used surface science methods due to their incompatibility with high pressures.The present grant application relies on a membrane approach for high pressure XPS under development in our laboratory. The method is based on a new type of specimen holder, which is a metallic, hydrogen permeable membrane fed on one side with a high hydrogen pressure and exposed on the other side to the X-ray beam at UHV-pressures. In first papers, we introduced the fundamental idea and demonstrated the feasibility of the method in some well-studied cases, paving the way for its use on relevant questions in energy storage. In this project, we want to utilize the membrane approach to prepare and measure in-situ various ionic and intermetallic hydrides as a function of the chemical potential of hydrogen, which will deliver insightful knowledge on the electronic structure of hydrides. In a second task, we want to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced hydrogen desorption from hydrogen membranes upon application of polymer coatings. Finding the physical origin of the remarkable effect may help to functionalize also hydrogen permeable metals other than Pd. Finally, the catalytic formation/decomposition of the C-H bond is one of the main challenges in synthetic chemistry, due to the strong covalent nature of this bond. The (de-) hydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, which take place at several tens of bar, are catalysed by Pd, Ru, or similarly expensive and scarce elements. Experiments on the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons using the Pd-membrane mimic the technical process, so that information on the reaction can be drawn. Finally, we want to explore the possibility of combining different spectroscopy methods (X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy) with the membrane approach.; hydrogen; hydride; hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons; x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy; palladium; hydrogen storage; catalysis; hydrogen selective membrane; polymer coating",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20400,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although primary renewable energy sources have the advantages of being sustainable and relatively benign in terms of impact on the environment and human health, the majorities are intermittent, based on daily, seasonal, and regional scales with considerable variability in supply.In this scenario, electrolyzers are vital for the development of a renewable energy-based economy. Indeed, the excess of secondary energy produced by primary renewable sources (intermittent by nature) can be converted by electrolyzers into H2 and O2, which can be easily stored even for a long term and reused where and when it is required, providing an alternative and, to some extent, more advanced storage system than batteries. In fact, the main advantage of electrolyzers compared to batteries is that the energy vector can be stored outside the electrochemical device allowing independent scaling of the power and the stored energy.The electrochemical reaction mostly hampering the performance of water electrolyzers is the anodic water splitting reaction, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, the search for highly active anodic catalysts is currently extremely lively.This project aims at developing advanced perovskite-based materials for application as OER catalysts in alkaline water electrolyzers. One of the main strength of the present project compared to the state-of-the-art approaches is the development of several operando characterizations using the synchrotron and neutron facilities available at the Paul Scherrer Institut. Indeed, only the combination of detailed ex situ and operando characterizations can truly disclose water splitting reaction mechanisms and design principles for highly active catalysts.The primary objectives of the present proposal can be summarized as: (i) development/advance of operando techniques to follow the catalyst properties in real-time; (ii) understanding the OER reaction mechanism on perovskite surface and design activity descriptors; (iii) developing highly OER active and low cost perovskite oxide catalysts for (co)-electrolysis applications. This approach is unique in the field because it not only combines a fundamental understanding of the water splitting reaction and of the electrocatalyst’s physico-chemical properties but also aims at real operating systems.

The perovskite solar cell technology has been already proven to be remarkably efficient and has scope to compete with the very best crystalline semiconductor and thin film photovoltaic systems while offering the very lowest potential cost for materials and solution processed manufacturing. Indeed, organic-inorganic perovskites have revolutionized the field of thin film solar cells because of their remarkably fast increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) which now reaches 22.1%2,3,4. The original perovskite structure ABX3 where A=Methylammonium (MA) or Formamidinium (FA), B=Pb and X=I, rapidly evolved into complex mixed cation/mixed halide perovskites, e.g. (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, which currently hold the lead in terms of solar cell efficiency. The higher efficiency compared to MAPbI3 perovskite structures has been generically attributed to the improved crystal quality of the film5, however, the exact reasons remain under intense debate. In particular, there is a complete lack of understanding of the nanoscale composition and structure of these mixed perovskite materials.  Our preliminary collaboration (EPFL-LIST) has demonstrated that nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is a very powerful approach to directly map the elemental composition of the surface of the active Perovskite-layer (paper submitted6). While this informal collaboration focused on the feasibility of the project (only surface analysis so far), we now plan to move one step further towards nanoscale correlative microscopy, i.e. combining morphology images obtained from secondary electrons with analytical (chemical) information obtained through SIMS. To achieve this goal, we will use the fact that LIST has recently developed SIMS systems dedicated to the Helium Ion Microscope (HIM) and DualBeam Gallium-Focused Ion Beam Microscope (Ga-FIB) that are unique in the world. In this research project, we plan to team up in order to gain unprecedented insight into perovskite materials by systematically analyzing their nanoscale elemental composition. This correlative nano-characterization performed by novel HIM-SIMS and FIB-SIMS microscopy will allow us to elucidate what makes the lead-based perovskite material so efficient. Using this knowledge, we will tailor design new material compositions that specifically meet the needs for the highest efficiencies and stability. More in general, this knowledge will provide guidance for the development of lead-free perovskite materials. As perovskite materials have been shown to be very interesting for other optoelectronic devices such as LED’s7 and lasers8, in addition to the afore-discussed solar cell applications, the findings of this proposal are relevant for future low-cost energy systems in general.; Helium Ion Microscopy; Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry; Focused Ionbeam Microscopy; Nanoscale analysis; Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials; Solar Cells",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the resent years, a variety of novel solid-state superionic conductors emerged; among them, the applicants developed a new class of solid-state electrolyte, namely hydroborates, to a point where they compete with state of the art oxide or sulfide based solid-state electrolytes. We real-ized a stable rechargeable 3 V all solid-state sodium battery based on a mixed anion hydroborate solid- state electrolyte, Na4(B12H12)0(B10H10), combining high ionic conductivity of about 1 mS cm-1 (at 30°C), an electrochemical stability window of ~3 V, thermal stability up to 300 °C, and mechanical softness enabling processing by cold pressing. Unlike oxide or sulfide-based elec-trolytes, the hydroborate is stable against sodium and a high capacity metallic sodium anode could be operated with a current density of 0.1 mA cm-1(C/5) at 60 °C. Cycling at higher scan rates or lower temperatures leads to cell failure due to short-circuiting. Generally, the combina-tion of high energy density (metallic anodes) and high power density (high rates) is a common challenge for solid-state batteries. Our proposal addresses basic materials properties of this novel, yet under-explored class of solid electrolytes in view of potential battery application. Specifically the ones concerning the an-ode/electrolyte interface: (i) what is the microscopic origin and a role of solid electrolyte in bat-tery short-circuiting (ii) what are the (electro-chemical) decomposition products of the electrolyte and (iii) are stable interphases towards the electrodes formed as in the case of conventional Li-ion batteries? To answer these questions, we identified the surface/interface stability to be essential. For hy-droborates, detailed studies of their surface properties are missing and this project aims at filling this knowledge gap. In a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we will investigate the chemical and electro-chemical compatibility between the electrolyte and the electrodes, in-cluding the identification of the reaction products at the border of stability limits and the effect of current density/temperature on long term cycling. Thereby, we will combine electrochemical characterization with scanning thermal techniques, microscopy, and operando X-ray diffraction.

Part of this change is contingent upon batteries for grid-balancing the intermittent electricity supply from renewable sources (e.g. wind, solar) and for electric vehicles. Due to their ability to store large amounts of energy in lightweight compact form, lithium-based technologies are now at the cutting-edge of research and development in energy storage. Reflecting this interest, the global demand for lithium is expected to multiply tenfold by 2050 and its price is increasing rapidly. Lithium has become one of the planet's most strategic commodities.As a natural commodity it is in many ways unique. It is relatively rare in nature and 70% of the world's exploitable reserves are located in the salares (salt flats) of three countries, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile (the so-called 'ABC' of lithium-rich countries), in socially and environmentally sensitive indigenous and high-altitude areas. The market configuration is also peculiar, with a very small number of firms producing the metal, and an equally small number of countries processing it in consumer goods such as portable consumer electronics. And it offers specific challenges for recycling given the premises of a circular economy (that consider the entire cycle of a product).From production to recycling, many issues could challenge the sustainable functioning of the lithium commodity chain: environmental, technological, legal, social and policy issues at the local-national level; market failures, strategic behavior and oligopoly at the international level; and a risk of lithium contributing to a 'throw away' instead of a sustainable society in consumer countries. Unless these issues are examined there are risks that a new reliance on lithium could contribute, instead of to a new 'green economy', to reinforcing mechanisms that produce the social and environmental problems that characterize the current 'brown economy' (fossil-fuel dependent).In light of this, our aim is to take stock of the lithium commodity chain from a political ecology and a governance perspectives. Can lithium, as a symbolic commodity for the green economy, be produced and consumed in a socially equitable and environmentally sustainable way? What are the implications of present and future market configurations for the metal? And what are the obstacles for a sound governance regime of this natural resource?This research is innovative in different aspects. It brings both empirical and theoretical contributions by producing a comprehensive, multi-level and interdisciplinary understanding of the lithium commodity chain, and developing a theoretical framework for global natural resources under the new paradigm of a green economy. What we have now is a very fragmentary view. While significant technical research on lithium as a metal has been conducted, there is very little research on the full commodity chain, on the social and environmental aspects of its extraction and consumption, on water issues, and on a regional comparison of the situation in the ABC countries. And while there are many studies of the market for lithium, none integrates all of these factors. Seeking to address these limitations, this project proposes to examine the global political ecology of lithium. Specifically, our purpose is to understand how governance processes and socio-environmental conditions at different levels are influenced by the global commodity chain of lithium, from ABC countries to Switzerland (as a high-end consumer country). The project builds on existing research collaborations and prior field experience. We seek to contribute to a strand of literature in political ecology, development and governance studies, as well as at the policy level.

Despite numerous experimental demonstrations, only a minor fraction of 2D materials have been explored, leading to poor understanding of the structure-property relationship (SPR) and hindering new material design. The colossal size of the configuration space (> 10^6 data points) makes it impractical to solve the SPR by conventional density functional theory (DFT) methods within reasonable computation time. Moreover, DFT approaches often fail to model the multiconfigurational electronic structures and long-range interactions which are crucial for their catalytic behaviors. To overcome the limitations of conventional approaches, this proposal aims to implement machine-learning assisted SPR (ML-SPR) models for 2D material catalysts, which has been successfully demonstrated for predicting catalytic activity of metallic surfaces. Particular effort will be focused on: i) effective generation of large-scale training datasets, ii) inclusion of long-range interactions in ML models, iii) understanding intrinsic catalytic mechanism thermochemistry on 2D material interfaces. A robust ML-SPR framework based on graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)is proposed to correctly capture both chemi-and physisorption on 2D heterogeneous interfaces, to perform material screening for various electrochemical reactions, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, molecular catalysis, etc. The ML-SPR framework provides insight into design rules on these materials and identifies ideal materials for experimental validation.Objectives: • Develop a unified GCNN framework to encode interfacial chem- and physisorption• Build machine learning potential for long-range interactions based on physically informed graph convolutional neural network (PIGCNN) • Use developed ML-SPR methods to screen two-dimensional materials for electrocatalysis applications  • Applying ML-SPR for various electrocatalysis systems (water splitting, CO2 conversion, oxyanion reduction, molecular catalysis, etc.) on 2D material interfaces • Systematic comparison of prediction accuracy and uncertainty between different ML-SPR approachesMethods to be used: The major method involved in the research is graph-based convolutional neuralnetwork (GCNN) on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. Particular effort will be paid to designand optimize the model for 2D material interfaces, as well as performance comparison with other materialscreening algorithms.Expected results and impact:The research project is expected to develop transferable machine learning models suitable for capturing both short- and long-range interactions, and further apply to study theheterogeneous catalysis on 2D materials interfaces. The developed ML-SPR model will help bridge thegap between theoretical and experimental studies of 2D-material-based catalysis.

The first is that there is a lack of cross-sectorial cooperation amongst governmental and planning institutions, which is associated with the second problem, poor public participation and related public opposition towards renewable energy projects. This suggests that improved approaches to planning energy transition with better designed stakeholder involvement are needed as projects are often discussed at a late planning phase and detached from other land use systems, hindering local implementation of national, European, and global policies. To link the global to local, regional scale of planning energy transition is considered specific enough to account for socio-economic and landscape context while still being broad enough to include an array of actors and tailor the process to the regional specifics. With this project we propose to develop and test an approach of integrating energy transition planning into participatory visioning of regional landscape development in four case regions (two in Slovenia, two in Switzerland) and evaluate how such an approach contributes to social learning among stakeholders and facilitates problem definition and finding solutions in different institutional settings. The overarching research question is: How does integrating energy development into regional landscape planning contribute to finding shared solutions on future energy transition? To find answers to this question, we propose to conduct participatory visioning processes in each of the case study regions, map the produced visions and shared solutions, evaluate the effects of the workshops on participants’ social learning and analyze how different institutional contexts affected the results. To achieve this, we will first conduct a systematic context analysis in the case study regions including spatial, social, and institutional aspects. Regional steering boards, constituted of key regional stakeholders, will be formed as an advisory body to keep the project as grounded in the regions as possible. Based on the findings of the context analysis, further stakeholders will be interviewed and surveyed to determine their problem perspectives of the energy transition in the region and preferred future development visions. This will serve as a pre-measurement of stakeholders’ perspectives on regional energy transition. The problem perspectives and visions revealed in the surveys will serve as key input into the participatory process, where the interviewed stakeholders will work together to form a vision of regional development, including energy transition. So, energy transition will be discussed in the context of future development of other systems in the region adopting an integrated landscape approach. The exact design of workshops will be custom tailored to each region’s context, but they will all strive to produce shared visions and solutions as an output. After the workshops, stakeholders’ perspectives will be recorded with qualitative interviews and standardized surveys again to provide a post-measurement, which will be compared to the pre-measurement to evaluate the participatory process and its social learning effects. To further propagate the learning effect, master students of landscape architecture will develop project ideas based on the visions. These will be discussed in interactive exhibitions in the study regions to stimulate a broader regional debate, which will again be systematically evaluated. In the final step we will compare the regions’ findings  and analyze how differing contexts, specifically institutional differences, impacted the results.

Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive source of sustainable molecules, which are essential for replacing fossil-derived chemicals that, unlike fuels, cannot be substituted by renewable electricity. Polymers are an example of such products: they are ubiquitous, vitally important, and produced from petroleum. In this project, we will produce sustainable polymers from lignin - a major biopolymer and one of the few natural large-scale sources of aromatic molecules. To do so, this project will bring together three groups specializing in the distinct areas involved in producing, deconstructing, and valorizing the lignin: plant biology, catalytic processing, and polymer science. The plant biology group will identify and characterize a series of plant lignins that offer the most promise for high-yield depolymerization to molecules that are especially relevant for material synthesis. We will also make available unusual natural lignins and lignins from plants that have been engineered to facilitate the production of certain lignin-derived monomers. Of particular interest are newly discovered catechol-containing lignins, and plants that contain high levels of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acid subunits associated with lignins, either naturally or from those already available through genetic manipulations. These catechol and carboxylic acid functionalities are particularly attractive in molecules targeted for polymer synthesis.The catalytic processing group will deconstruct lignin to small molecules. We have recently shown that by using chemical protecting agents during biomass deconstruction, we could prevent lignin degradation and increase lignin monomer yields 3-7 times compared to previously available methods. We are able to produce a soluble isolated lignin fraction that can be converted to small molecules at near-theoretical yields, which offers unprecedented opportunities for catalytic processing. Starting with well-characterized common wild-type ‘natural’ lignins, newly discovered native lignins and available transgenic lignins, the catalytic processing group will scale up the production of, and separate, lignin-derived molecular mixtures. We will also develop new reductive, oxidative and acid-catalyzed catalytic processing routes for these monomers to produce molecules with catechol, carboxylic acid, diol and styrene functionalities, all of which a valuable commodity chemicals and excellent polymer precursors. Finally, the polymer science group will exploit the production of both known and novel lignin-based monomers at unprecedented yields for the practical production of sustainable polymers and the discovery of new materials. Unlike previous work based on using purified model compounds for polymer synthesis, special emphasis will be placed on developing synthetic routes from real lignin monomer mixtures that can be made increasingly homogeneous by the first two groups. The polymer science group will also focus on exploiting the novel catechol and tri- or tetrafunctional monomers to create new types of adhesives and hyperbranched polymers, as well as chemical modification of monomers to expand the range of accessible materials.With its highly interdisciplinary nature spanning several fields that rarely intersect, this project will create new conversion routes, alternatively exploiting biosynthesis, catalysis, or synthesis, and will enable the practical production of new sustainable materials with a wide range of valuable properties.; lignin biosynthesis; Green chemistry; polymers; Energy; Biomass; Lignin",3,1,Collaborative,4,1,More than one discipline,NA,20300,20500,30100,30200,NA

Currently, a further PIC technology is at the crossroad of making this transition in the coming years: Specifically, Kerr-nonlinear silicon nitride (Si3N4) microresonator based frequency comb generators. Such compact, chip-scale combs are a disruptive technology to various fields with applications in broadband, coherent optical spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, timekeeping, signal generation, optical sensing and laser ranging as well as high-bandwidth optical telecommunication. The present research consortium (EPFL & CSEM) have been at  the forefront of these technological developments, which include the first demonstration of low noise ultra-short soliton pulse sources in PIC (EPFL, Science 2015 & Nature Photonics 2013), ultra-efficient pulsed optical pumping of microresonators (CSEM, Nature Photonics 2016, in revision) and most recently coherent optical communication over 70 km with data rates exceeding 30 Tb/s  using EPFL’s chip based frequency comb generators 5 (Nature, 2017, in press).  An important advance towards the commercial use of Si3N4 nonlinear photonic waveguides has been the development of novel fabrication method, the photonic damascene process, at EPFL that has overcome the materials processing issue related to the high stress. This process, developed and optimized in the precoR program, is now transitioning outside of the laboratory, and part of the process portfolio of LiGenTec SA, a spinoff from EPFL that is making Si3N4 widely available to academics and industry alike.

Yet to date, photonic chipscale frequency combs are not yet part of a commercial product or development. Indeed, the key challenges for the commercialization of chip-scale frequency combs are predominantly their low energy efficiency, which affects optical packaging, choice of availability of laser modules and determines long-term full photonic integration on a chip, and finally market potential for telecommunications. In this project, we aim to address these challenges via two routes that complement each other:First, EPFL will develop novel techniques to produce low loss dispersion engineered photonic integrated waveguides, both with regard to resonator geometry as well as material. Specifically, the resonator’s quality-factor and mode dispersion will be improved to enable broadband optical soliton spectra at significantly lower threshold power than presently the case. A key challenge, that of efficient input coupling to the PIC, will be solved via a novel 3D tapered waveguide. Second, CSEM will develop pulsed optical pumping for driving and controlling ultra-short soliton pulses in the PIC fabricated by EPFL. Pumping the PICs with temporally structured light will not only allow for substantial reduction of required pump laser power, but will also allow for control and stabilization of soliton pulse number, soliton repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency.The outcome of the project will provide the technology for compact PIC based frequency combs with 2-4 orders of magnitude increased energy efficiency and intrinsic stabilization bridging the gap between academic research and commercialization of PIC based frequency comb generators.; Photonic Damascene fabrication process; Silicon Nitride microresonators; electro-optic comb",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20400,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is imperative, therefore, to develop characterisation methods that are able to probe the physicochemical materials properties on the very local scale, or even to manipulate these properties at the atomic level in a fully controlled manner. Towards this goal, the advancements of electron microscopy nowadays enable scientists to look into the atomic structure of nanomaterials with unprecedented spatial resolution. However, a qualitative evaluation of the properties at the nanoscale can no longer facilitate the further advancement needed for transferring these materials from the research environment to an enhanced, commercially available product. The reliability and reproducibility of such devices is critical and quantitative evaluation of atomic scale reactions becomes a requirement. To this end, this SNSF project proposal, that will support two PhD studentships, aims to begin addressing fundamental questions governing the functionality of nanostructures by applying and developing in situ nanoanalytical transmission (TEM) electron microscopy techniques. The approach is two-fold and it is centred in linking the exceptional properties of ABO3-type perovskites to site specific reaction mechanisms that can directly be extrapolated to the bulk-like behaviour of the corresponding devices. The first objective is to address issues with the miniaturisation of polar, lead-free perovskites, which are on the forefront of the microelectronic industry for high frequency electronics and memory-based devices. These devices are based on structures that their usability is inhibited by the slow relaxation processes which occur under voltage pulses. The main mechanism responsible for this relaxation is the residual polarisation caused by the space charge formed due to the injection of electrons from electrodes and its trapping by defects and/or oxygen vacancies on the oxide-electrode interface and/or inside the perovskite itself. To quantitative evaluate the polar system in its entity, a systematic study of the effect of electrical poling of single crystal and ceramic ferroelectrics in varying temperatures as a function of electric bias will be undertaken. This will be done in situ in a TEM and the fields will be measured by means of electron holography, which provides a direct measurement of the phase changes of the electron wave. Secondly, fundamental structural and chemical evolution mechanisms of active catalytic sites in ABO3-type perovskites will be addressed. Developing renewable energy production and storage technologies represents a major challenge nowadays. The synthesis of efficient, highly active, and cost-effective catalysts for use in electrochemical energy conversion processes, such as the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, is a critical area of research with international interest. Perovskite-type catalysts exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and are the best contender in replacing the conventional, costly, metal ones. Their applicability, however, is hindered due to the little knowledge of the actual mechanisms by which the reactions proceed. To address this, electrical measurements of catalysts in liquids will be performed in situ in a micro-volume of the solution in a TEM. This will lead to valuable insights on optimal geometry, active surface sites, and on local degradation mechanisms of the devices that will ultimately aid in engineering novel, high performing catalysts.; in situ TEM; perovskites; catalysts; ferroelectrics; energy storage; energy production",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

Key performance characteristics of modern nanomaterials for energy applications, such as electrocatalysts for fuel cells, cathodes for lithium-ion batteries and electrodes for solar cells, are determined by the fundamental physicochemical properties of the nanoscale entities (nanoparticles, reaction sites, defects), where chemical events mainly take place. Understanding materials’ behavior at a nanoscale, and at a single entity level, is therefore crucial for the design of the next generations of materials and technologies.This ambitious multidisciplinary project seeks new paradigms for probing, visualizing and manipulating nanoscale objects and particles with the use of positional nanopipettes, with further application of these advanced methodologies to study nanoelectrocatalysts. Nanopipette methods have recently shown their great potential for microscopy and imaging structural and functional properties, such as surface charge and chemical reactivity, with nanoscale resolution and unprecedented imaging rates, which puts them on the leading edge of the current development of scanning probe microscopy instrumentation. Here, significant advances of the current nanopipette techniques are proposed, with the goal to extend the capabilities of present methods and to convert a nanopipette into a powerful platform for manipulation of nanoobjects and for probing spatial distributions of heat. These novel experimental approaches would open up new perspectives on characterization of physicochemical nanoscale properties of single entities and will provide new insights on nanoscale electrocatalysis, presently inaccessible with conventional techniques.The objective of the project is twofold: i) imaging and manipulation of individual particles with sizes varying from a few nanometers (~5 nm) and up to tens of nanometers (depending on application) with nanometer-scale resolution and further examination of their physicochemical characteristics and performance for application as fuel cell catalysts; and ii) probing local temperature distributions in nanoscale environments on individual nanoparticles and assessment of their catalytic properties depending on temperature. In this project, nanoscale nanopipette imaging/manipulation concept will be developed using powerful potential of the scanning ion conductance microscopy. This nanoscale scanning probe technique will be advanced to perform dielectrophoretic and nanofluidic particle manipulation along with thermal imaging for the unique analysis of the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. Accordingly, the project is structured into three tasks: i) construction of the cutting edge electrochemical imaging platform, ii) development of particle manipulation techniques based on nanopipettes and their applications to study particle-electrode collisions, particle adsorption, real-time monitoring chemical reactions on individual particles, weighting individual particles, study particle dissolution and surface processes, and iii) development of nanoscale thermal imaging technique to investigate the effects of local temperature on performance characteristics of nanoelectrocatalysts.The new methodologies that will develop in this project will be established, tested, modeled and used to study fundamentally and industrially significant interfaces and chemical reactions. Importantly, the project will be conducted in a highly collaborative environment of Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zurich (ETHZ), with the access to facilities of the excellent quality, and will amalgamate complementary expertise of the applicant and the Host Group (Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics), therefore ensuring the overall success of the research programme. It is further important to emphasize that the methods to be developed and used in this project will subsequently be widely applicable in many areas, spanning physical sciences, materials science, nanotechnology and across other disciplines, ensuring that this project has the potential for major multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary impact in fundamental and applied sciences, and will have wider academic, societal and economic impact.; nanoparticle; nanopipette; electrocatalysis; scanning probe methods; electrochemistry; nanomanipulation",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

They have many advantages compared to conventional inorganic materials, since they are cost-efficient, non-toxic, chemically tunable and mechanically flexible. Great progress has been made in recent years to push the efficiency of organic electronic devices towards and beyond the one of other technologies. This has led to the development of new organic materials with complex optoelectronic properties, offering great opportunities to address fundamental scientific questions and to gain essential feedback about the underlying working principles of the applications. Here, we plan to investigate particularly timely and topical aspects of organic electronics, exploiting our exceptional expertise with ultrafast spectroscopy to bring unique insights to a broad and diverse field. Specifically, we will focus on the photophysics of non-fullerene acceptors and interfacial processes in organic solar cells and study the conductivity of doped organic semiconductors. In the last couple of years, non-fullerene acceptors have replaced fullerene acceptors in photovoltaic blends with electron-donating conjugated materials. Their superior performance has allowed record power conversion efficiencies, re-launching organic photovoltaics to the forefront of attention. Non-fullerene solar cells are characterized by fundamentally different photophysics compared to fullerene-based systems, for example extremely small driving forces for charge transfer lead to high open circuit voltages. Our first objective will be to relate charge transfer rates and recombination mechanisms to these small driving forces in non-fullerene systems using transient absorption spectroscopy from the femtosecond to microsecond range. Our second objective will be to include dispersive charge transport in the picture, measuring it from the few-nanometer scale to macroscopic device distances with a combination of terahertz, electro-absorption and transient photocurrent experiments. We expect a comprehensive picture of charge generation, recombination and transport as a function of energetic and morphological parameters. Since short-range mobility also plays an essential role in the separation of charges from interfacial charge transfer states (which we directly visualize using electro-modulated differential absorption spectroscopy), we envisage to find correlations between the charge separation efficiency and the terahertz short-range mobility. Another crucial parameter for this dissociation is the molecular-level interfacial structure (conformations, orientations, packing), which has been little investigated due to the experimental challenge to address the interface. Our third objective will be to use (interface-specific) vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy to establish structure-property relations in model donor:fullerene and donor:non-fullerene bilayers. We expect to unravel links between interfacial structure, energetics, charge dynamics and short-range mobility. Finally, doped organic semiconductors are increasingly used as conductive interlayers in solar cells, light-emitting diodes and transistors. Our fourth objective is therefore to bring new insights to the electronic structure, doping mechanisms and charge transport in doped organic materials using transient absorption and terahertz spectroscopy. We foresee to determine the optimal parameters governing high doping efficiency and conductivity, with particularly novel insights for self-doped conjugated polyelectrolytes that are conductive without addition of external dopants. Overall, the outcome of our research provides essential guidelines to the organic electronics community for design strategies of highly efficient devices, contributing on the mid-term to large-scale implementation of flexible electronics and cheap solar energy conversion.

Particle-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has the potential to produce solar hydrogen at a lower cost than fossil fuel-derived hydrogen, and is therefore a disruptive technology that could free us from a fossil fuel-based economy. Additionally, the use of the oxidizing equivalents to fabricate useful chemicals from biomass (instead of water oxidation to generate oxygen) represents a paradigm shift for a sustainable chemical industry. However, new materials are needed to achieve the stability and efficiencies that are required for low cost hydrogen production. Studying semiconductor materials as thin films enables the use of a suite of techniques for in-depth characterization and understanding, leading to the identification of limitations and subsequent improvement of the system. Thus, this proposal targets new thin film semiconductor materials, which could be adapted to particulate systems in future projects. The first line of research focuses on Sb2Se3, a new material that we found is intrinsically stable in acidic solutions under full solar illumination. It is a strong candidate for a practical, scalable photocathode material if the efficiency can be improved, which is the aim of this section. We will further develop another chalcogenide material that can be fabricated both as a photocathode (for hydrogen evolution) and a photoanode (for oxidation of biomass to value added chemicals) by simple modification of the synthesis conditions. The second line of research involves the use of advanced analytical techniques to gain a complete understanding of the underlying (photo)physical processes in PEC materials, which is quite complex. We wish to further develop our novel implementation of the dual working electrode technique, as well as transient photocurrent and photovoltage studies using our newly built setup. Moreover, we will use atomic force microscopy (for example, carrying out electrochemistry with the tip) for a microscopic analysis of these systems. Our grand aim is to find a general (photo)physical model that can be applied across a wide range of PEC systems, for fast identification of the limitations and rapid improvement in these systems.; value added chemicals; hydrogen; antimony selenide; water splitting; impedance spectroscopy",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the multi-keV energy range it allows combining high penetration and resolution, thereby non-destructive imaging, in the nanometer resolution range in large volumes, an imaging regime otherwise uncovered. Over the last decade several microscopes dedicated to 3D ptychography have been developed and built at PSI, including a continuous development of the related data reconstruction pipelines. Today, imaging is routinely done and thus scientific questions in the areas from biology to materials science can be investigated. In high-contrast samples a 3D resolution of below 10 nm has been reached, which is more than an order of magnitude improvement over more conventional X-ray tomography approaches.Founding on our world-leading instrumentation and resolution, we will further shrink the resolution gap to electron microscopy in this project by improving resolution down to 3 nm. Resolution is sample dependent, and is ultimately limited by radiation damage. In this project we aim at reaching highest resolution in high-contrast, radiation insensitive samples. This will allow 3D ptychography to replace current destructive imaging techniques and directly contribute to the development of material science. Our project will thereby generate important knowledge on ultimate X-ray microscopy limits. Most synchrotrons around the word, including the Swiss Light Source, undergo upgrade programs towards a diffraction limited storage ring. Ptychography can directly employ the expected increase in coherent flux and the present project will deliver an important knowledge base needed for improved imaging at next-generation storage rings.Increasing resolution in 3D ptychographic imaging requires addressing several limiting factors. Experiments with stepwise increasing difficulty are planned. All samples have scientific relevance and the related science projects will directly benefit from higher resolution: In a first step, developments and imaging demonstrations will be performed on a 3D gyroid sample. These are binary objects with high contrast and have proven very radiation hard. At currently reachable resolution data analysis suffers and measurements of samples with smallest structures are not possible. In a second step such demonstrations will be extended to the imaging of integrated circuits (ICs). Microscopy of ICs is the foundation for the optimization of production and design, as well as for failure analysis and the detection of malicious hardware for critical applications. Already in the sub-20 nm resolution range, 3D ptychography has proven useful for the imaging of ICs, allowing resolving the chip’s connectome. Here we envision to perform the first imaging of a damage caused by electrostatic discharge. Today such imaging and analysis is done via destructive methods, which unfortunately can cause damage during the imaging process. Finally, the imaging of polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (PEWE) anodic catalyst layers is planned. PEWE offers great opportunities for storing excess electricity provided by fluctuating renewable energy sources. However, long-term operation is required for the widespread commercialization of this technology. The related particles are covered by a layer, which currently cannot be resolved by our X-ray tomography. This layer is however crucial for the functioning of PEWE cells and resolving it in 3D will be of direct impact in the related electrochemistry projects.; X-ray nano tomography; High-resolution 3D imaging; X-ray ptychography",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20400,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our focus will be in combining the absorption (ligand) and/or catalytic site (metal centre) and/or co-catalyst (e.g. platinum nanoparticles) utilised by current photocatalysts into a singular crystalline high surface area material, constructing an ‘ideal’ nanoporous photocatalyst that when placed in water with sunlight can split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen being captured and used as a fuel.MOFs are infinite networks consisting of metal ions or clusters bridged by organic ligands through a covalent bond into a porous structure. COFs are also porous networks constructed solely by organic ligands linked to each other through strong covalent bonds. The flexibility offered by these high surface area materials to incorporate any ligand or any metal ion (in the case of MOFs), together with the integration of various functionalities within their structures to form thermally, chemically and water stable materials, offer advantages that so far have provided limited success in hydrogen generation applications. Thus the long-term aim of the project is to use the flexibility of these materials to systematically study and improve the overall solar efficiency to a commercial viable level and showcase the potential of these nanoporous materials as photocatalysts for water splitting.Utilising the world-class infrastructure within the LSMO lab and at EPFL Valais Wallis, the project intends to start with the strategic construction of water stable MOFs based on a number of visible light active ligands (based on various conducting chromophores) and high valence or transition metal ions utilising the automated robotic synthesiser. Photoactive ligands will be also incorporated within the structures of COFs and so analogues to the carbon-nitride g-C3N4 photocatalyst can be constructed. The main advantage of this synthetic platform is that we can use the chemical flexibility of MOF/COF chemistry to systematically study the effects of different visible light active ligands within their structures. To advance our studies, we intend to generate composite based hybrid materials by combining MOF or COF crystals with four distinct families of NanoParticles (NP) that can potentially improve the hydrogen generation efficiency. The synthesis of novel composites that marry the best properties of each component is highly beneficial as with the nanoporous MOF/COF able to absorb in the visible region of the spectrum, electronic contact between MOF/COF and NP will facilitate the excited state ligand electron to migrate to the NP, in a process analogous to that used in peroviskite or dye-sensitized solar cells and allow the NP, with its reducing metal centre to participate in redox reactions. The materials isolated are going to further be grown/integrated on conducting surfaces and tested as part of a photochemical cell, characterising the photoactivity of the generated composites under visible light, and so demonstrating electric contact between the components of the composite itself.As a final step of the project, we aim to develop a novel high-throughput protocol for testing the potential of these materials for hydrogen generation. The combination of the automated synthesis providing potentially many candidate nanoporous visible light active materials with a next generation Gas Chromatography, capable of automatically testing up to 108 individual samples, will enable us to assess the photocatalytic performance of these materials in short periods of time, identify an ‘ideal’ material with superior performance towards water splitting with high hydrogen evolution efficiency, study and understand its activity in great detail and then scale up its synthesis and test its potential in industrial scale.Whilst an application such as this one, is impressive and with inspiring goal, its actual achievement and commercial viability is very challenging.

The project starts from the observation that infrastructure solutions in energy, water or transportation use the same design principles all over the world, even though the material and cultural preconditions vary greatly between places. Change toward locally adapted (and potentially more sustainable) solutions is hindered by dominant designs that are hard to change even by the most visionary entrepreneurs. In GLORIWA, this lock-in is attributed to internationalized actor structures and institutional rationalities that stabilize and diffuse a dominant model of ‘modern’ infrastructure in space (i.e. global socio-technical regimes).Conceptualizing socio-technical regimes as ‘global’ is a radically novel idea at the intersection of transition studies, innovation studies and economic geography. Transition literature to date almost exclusively drew national or regional spatial boundaries, assuming that infrastructure transformation (e.g. the transition from fossil to renewable energy) plays out predominantly at urban, regional or national scales (Coenen et al., 2012). Whether and how transformation dynamics are influenced by international interdependencies in today’s quickly globalizing knowledge economy has been largely ignored (Fuenfschilling and Binz, 2017). The GLORIWA project aims at filling this gap by 1) further specifying and operationalizing transition studies’ socio-technical regime concept, 2) analyzing how certain design principles gain dominance in international arenas, and 3) assessing global regime rationalities diffuse in space. By visualizing and analyzing the global actor structure in urban water management, GLORIWA will unpack in detail the mechanisms through which a regime rationality stabilizes and influences infrastructure design decisions in various places around the world. The global socio-technical regime in urban water management will be reconstructed based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods and data sources. Secondary databases will be revised to qualitatively map the global actor structure in urban water management. Social Network Analysis and Discourse Network Analysis will then be used to examine which firms, consultants or NGOs occupy the most central network position in this actor structure and thus enjoy definitional authority in framing certain technologies as global model solution. This quantitative analysis will then be combined with qualitative expert interviews in order to reconstruct in detail the process through which dominant regime solutions are diffused beyond their place of origin. The results from the water sector will be cross-compared with a parallel research initiative at Lund University, Sweden, conducting regime analyses in the chemical and paper and pulp sectors. By systematically mapping and analyzing these global structures, GLORIWA and its partner activities will contribute novel ideas on how infrastructure transformation may be understood and governed not only at a national, but increasingly at an international level.; infrstructure; sustainability transition; urban water management; socio-technical regime; globalization",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,10400,10600,NA,NA,NA,NA

Discovery of novel materials are called for with potential applications in various technologically relevant fields such as energy production and storage, novel electronic devices, data storage, medical application and catalysis. Instead of synthesizing and characterizing novel materials in time-consuming, expensive experiments, theoretical material scientists have started to create databases obtained from all materials known to date and to systematically analyze them with high-throughput computation methods, trying to gain insight on how chemistry and structures are linked to material properties and to extract patterns from the underlying data. New, innovative computational methods are needed to efficiently characterize the continuously growing amount of materials data, and techniques need to be developed to extrapolate materials properties to design novel, undiscovered compounds with improved properties.

However, there is a growing demand for low-power autonomously learning AI systems that are employed “in the field”. We will investigate in this project options for learning in low-power unconventional hardware that is based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented in analog neuromorphic hardware combined with nano-scale memristive synaptic devices. Hence, the envisioned computational paradigm combines the three most promising avenues for minimizing energy consumption in hardware: (1) analog neuromorphic computation, (2) spike-based communication, and (3) memristive analog memory. Experts in each of these fields will collaborate on the development of a functional prototype system. We will in particular consider recurrent SNNs (RSNNs) as theirinternal recurrent dynamics render them more suitable for real-world AI applications that have temporal input and demand some form of short-term memory. We will adapt a recently developed training algorithm such that it can be used to optimize SNNs in neuromorphic hardware with memristive synapses. “In the field” applications often demand online adaptation of such systems, which often necessitates hardware-averse training procedure. To overcome this problem, we will investigate the applicability of “learning to learn” (L2L) to spiking memristive neuromorphic hardware. In an initial optimization, the hardware is trained to become a good learner for the target application. Here, arbitrarily complex learningalgorithms can be used on a host system with the hardware “in the loop”. In the application itself, simpler algorithms - that can be easily implemented in neuromorphic hardware - provide adaptation of the hardware RSNNs.

PEC devices have the potential to be an essential part of this transition. The two-step energy conversion from solar energy to electricity (i.e. solar cell) and from electricity to chemical energy (i.e. electrolyzer) is combined to a single-step conversion from solar to chemical energy. Higher efficiencies, lower investment, and reduced consumption of materials and land are expected advantages of this approach. Although efficiencies of PEC devices are still not sufficient for commercialization, much progress has been made in the fundamental scientific understanding of which material properties and device configurations are necessary to achieve high-performance PEC devices. However, there is a second technical requirement that is essential to achieve economic and commercial success: The devices should be long-lived enough to achieve a positive energy and cost balance. Many proposed devices show decent efficiencies, but unconvincing long-term stabilities, if they are reported at all. Typically, the efficiency of PEC devices drops to 80% or less of their initial efficiency within hours or even faster.The complexity to address the challenge of long-term stability is rooted in the lack of fundamental scientific understanding, which of the many processes in PEC devices are responsible for the fast decay in efficiency. PEC devices go through a complex sequence of processes to complete their function: light absorption, charge separation, charge diffusion/migration, charge transfer to the surface or cocatalyst, electrochemical reaction, and charge transport in and through the electrolyte/reactant. Via exposure to light and electrical current, the simultaneously occurring processes in the different components can be altered over time and it is not obvious, which of the steps dominate performance degradation. The lack of in-depth studies on PEC device degradation inhibits identifying the limiting process and improving devices.The goal of this project is to study two different yet highly relevant photocatalyst materials to obtain a general understanding of degradation processes and their effect on device performance as well as to define guidelines for degradation testing, mitigation, and accelerated testing protocols. We will focus on scalable particle-based photoelectrode systems. This allows identifying the dominating degradation mechanisms at the atomic, meso as well as at the device scale. We will achieve this goal by experiments combined with atomic- and continuum-scale theoretical calculations. This combination results in the unique opportunity to propagate atomic-scale material changes to the device scale, where they are combined with morphology changes and changes in the local environment to predict the overall effect of degradation and the resulting performance. Given the ability of the multi-scale models to predict experimentally accessible material characteristics and device performance, this will allow linking performance degradation to specific alterations of the materials or the device.The limited number of attempts made to prevent degradation are rooted in the lack of knowledge on photocorrosion or, more generally, on degradation processes in PEC devices. This project will provide significant contributions to fill this knowledge gap and will promote a focus on long-term stability in the field of PEC energy conversion, crucially needed to ensure future sustainable energy supply for the society. The significance and the practical impact of the results of this project will be demonstrated by improving the stability of one of the studied PEC devices by at least one order of magnitude.; Degradation; Photoelectrochemistry; Multi-scale; Durability; Corrosion; Experiment; Theory",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,NA,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA

In this regard, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for high performance energy storage devices due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and ease of processibility. Over the last two decades, the LIBs contained liquid electrolytes (LEs) as the primary electrolyte choice because of their high ionic conductivity and favorable wettability properties at the electrode interfaces. However, LEs generally suffer from severe drawbacks such as 1) safety and leaking problems, 2) low thermal stability, 3) poor electrochemical stability, and 4) uncontrolled ion selectivity. Replacing the LEs with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) will alleviate the major problems of LEs. Integration of SSEs into the Li-metal batteries will lead to the Li-metal solid-state batteries (LiM-SSBs). The superiority of LiM-SSBs emanates from its ability to prevent leaking problems and afford dense stacking of bipolar electrodes, which enhance the energy density with a safe-miniaturized battery device. The SSEs can be classified into two main categories: inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) and polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs). Despite the fact that ISEs generally present high ionic conductivity, transference number, wide electrochemical stability window, large modulus, and good thermal stability. They lack interfacial stability with both electrodes, have high cost and toxicity problems, which limit their practical applications. Unlike ISEs, PSEs endure intimate wetting properties, minimized mass densities, low cost, and ease of large-scale processing. However, PSEs suffer from the limited ionic conductivity and transference number at room temperature, poor cathodic interface, and low storage modulus. In this project, to overcome these inherent drawbacks and surpass the current research state of SSEs, this proposal is focusing on the development of functional inorganic polymer solid electrolytes (FIPSEs) based on polyphosphates. The significance of FIBSEs based on polyphosphate is its ability to combine the advantages of both PSEs and ISEs and alleviate their problems.The proposed strategies in this project are divided into three work packages (WPs) to address the drawbacks of PSEs. The approaches of  (WP-1) targeting high ionic conductivity (Li+), suppression of lithium dendrites, and wide electrochemical stability window. Furthermore, the phosphate units will improve the poor oxidative stability towards high voltage cathodes. In (WP-2), we target the improvement of the Li-transference number (TLi) and interfacial resistance by doping the polyphosphate with anion traps leading to improve the (TLi) diffusivity and interfacial stability.. In (WP-3), we aim to enhance the mechanical stability accompanied by exceptional (TLi) via converting the polyphosphate copolymer to a dynamic single-ion conducting polyphosphate. Each WP will be comprehensively investigated via (in-situ / ex-situ) chemical and electrochemical characterization to elucidate chemical, physical and electrochemical properties. These findings will establish a new platform of PSEs that acquire the advantages of ISEs integrated into PSEs called FIPSEs and thus push the research boundaries of LiM-SSBs technology.; Inorganic polymers; Lithium Metal Anodes; Energy Storage ; Solid-State Batteries; Polymer Solid Electrolytes",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the electrolyzer anode is central to the development of a clean, reliable and emissions-free hydrogen economy since this reaction is hampered by slow kinetics and significant overpotential losses. The development of robust and highly active anode materials for the OER is therefore a great challenge and it has been the focus of much research attention. Towards this end, significant efforts have been directed to the study of the OER activity and stability of several candidate materials. Among these, perovskites have finally emerged as a promising electrocatalysts for the OER. In addition, perovskites show a very desirable design feature in that their electronic properties can be varied in a controlled fashion by substituting in the ABO3 structure the A and B cations, allowing a wide range of compositions to be explored. Such substitutions lead to modifications of the perovskite band structure which in turn might directly affect their catalytic properties. Perovskites’ energy bands are very distinctive and they can be regarded as arising solely from the B site cations. The B cation is most commonly a transition metal, providing the key d-band electrons, and recent works have proposed that perovskite OER electrocatalytic activity depends on the B site electronic configuration. However, no investigations have so far reported on how the perovskite electronic and geometric structure changes during the OER (notably, as a function of electrochemical potentials) or on how it can correlate with the reaction barriers, kinetics, and overpotential. Furthermore, it has recently emerged that the surface compositions of perovskite catalysts can significantly differ from the bulk composition due to surface segregation of various elements. These findings point towards the paramount necessity to deeply study the surface properties of the perovskite catalysts before and after the oxygen evolution reaction, which might cause a further change in the surface composition.The main goal of the present project is to provide a fundamental understanding of OER mechanism and of the design principles governing the OER of highly active perovskite catalysts. This could represent an important breakthrough in the development of efficient energy storage devices. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the novelty of the present study lies in the emphasis pointed towards the fundamental importance of understanding the material electronic structure in operando conditions. This can be achieved through times resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) measurements, which will provide snapshots of the electronic states under operational conditions. Furthermore, we want to investigate how the surface properties of the most promising perovskites catalysts differ from the bulk ones and how they are modified after operative conditions in the OER regime by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).Finally this research project wants to explore the OER catalytic activity of perovskite catalysts beyond the standard alkaline electrolyzer applications (i.e., in neutral electrolyte solution). Indeed, we want to explore the potential applicability of perovskite catalyst for water-oxidation at the anode side coupled with CO2 reduction at the cathode side in CO2-electrolyzers or (or also known as co-electrolyzers). This work will be performed establishing a strong collaboration with Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research (SCCER) directed by Prof Thomas Schmidt at Paul Scherrer Institut, which is currently financing a research project aiming to the development of cathode materials for co-electrolyzers. The preliminary data acquired during the present project might open new prospective for additional funding for a future project based on co-electrolyzer development.; electrocatalysis; perovskites; electrolyzer",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

These processes appear prominently in spin-based electronic devices, which underpin modern technologies of magnetic storage and sensing. Whereas some of these processes have been known for a long time, recent insight into nonequilibrium phenomena induced by spin-orbit coupling in magnetic and nonmagnetic materials has opened new perspectives to control the interconversion of the magnetic, electronic, and phononic degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems. The main aim of this project is to test new concepts for generating and probing spin currents in transition metals and topological insulators and use spin-currents generated by spin-orbit coupling to efficiently control the dynamics of the magnetization in ferromagnets and ferrimagnets. To achieve this aim we propose activities that include the synthesis of material heterostructures, their physical characterization, the design of novel probes, and the prototyping of devices. In particular, we plan to probe the conversion of heat and spin currents in metals and topological insulators and time-resolve the magnetization dynamics driven by spin-orbit torques and thermal effects in ferromagnets and ferrimagnets. This project will take advantage of the complementary experimental approaches developed by our group over the last few years, which allow for mapping the spin and orbital accumulation in nonmagnetic materials, measure current-induced magnetization reversal with high temporal and spatial resolution, and realize synthetic magnets with tailored properties. Furthermore, we plan to develop new techniques to measure the Hall effect in real time during pulsed current injection, which might be applicable to a broad set of problems in condensed matter physics. Overall, we expect that this project will provide new insight into fundamental transport and magnetization phenomena and ultimately benefit the development of high-performance spintronic devices that integrate different types of functions and operate at high speed with minimum energy consumption.  ; Magnetism; Spintronics; spin-orbit coupling",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20400,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

To ensure energy efficiency, the development of novel materials, specifically metallic alloys, becomes indispensable. For example, alloying tungsten, the primary candidate for plasma-facing materials in nuclear fusion power plants, with rhenium increases the fracture toughness at elevated temperatures by a multiple, compared to pure tungsten, and, therefore, the lifetime of reactors (Ren et al., 2018, IJRMHM 75). Its behavior under irradiation yet remains to be investigated, however, many of the underlying mechanisms cannot be directly observed in real experiments. This requires a computer-aided materials design approach in which these mechanisms are quantified by simulation in order to predict experimentally-observed phenomena. The state-of-the-art computing hardware and algorithms can simulate hundreds of atoms by direct atomistic simulations with density functional theory (DFT) which allows for an accurate prediction of ideal crystalline properties, such as phase stability or elastic moduli. However, in realistic materials many critical properties, such as yield strength or fracture toughness, are determined by the microstructure and, hence, require a multiscale approach. Presently, multiscale simulations are prohibitively expensive with DFT and, in lieu thereof, carried out with empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs). However, existing EIPs can, at their best, only suggest a qualitative mechanism but remain inadequate for a quantitative understanding of multicomponent systems and chemical interactions.The recently-emerging class of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) holds great promise to push these frontiers to a new level. However, for larger systems, possibly involving tens of thousands of atoms, their development is still in its infancy. In particular, there exists no straightforward approach to generate training data for atomic neighborhoods which are not just representative of the bulk material, i.e., in the vicinity of defects, such as dislocations, cracks or grain boundaries. However, a hypothetical, perfectly-trained MLIP---although orders of magnitude more efficient than DFT---will still be too expensive for large-scale problems. Therefore, the proposed project follows a novel approach combining machine learning, multiscale modeling and state-of-the-art numerical methods.The first part of the project is devoted to the development of a novel training procedure with controllable accuracy for MLIPs to be used in atomic-scale simulations of dislocations and their interactions with point defects. The proposed algorithm follows a top-down approach by extracting the training set directly from the large-scale simulation. This will be achieved using active learning to identify only parts of the atomistic domain where the MLIP becomes inaccurate, and out of which the algorithm subsequently constructs the training configurations. This idea stands in contrast to the classical bottom-up approach, where the potential is trained with respect to a huge, predetermined database, often decoupled from the actual quantities of interest.In practice, simulating dislocation motion is performed using infinite arrays of infinitely long, parallel dislocations. However, this method requires very large cell sizes to mitigate spurious effects from the image dislocations. This will be addressed in the second part which is devoted to the development of an atomistic/continuum coupling method, circumventing this problem by restricting atomic resolution to a region around the dislocation core, coupled to a very efficient exterior discrete boundary element method such that the overall computational cost scales with the size of the fully atomistic region.The proposed algorithms will be applied to study dislocation motion in pure bcc W and W-H systems. In hydrogen-based nuclear fusion reactors the transport of H atoms through dislocation propagation is expected to play a crucial role for the embrittlement of W-based materials, but, to date, no EIP exists to quantify the contributing mechanisms. Therefore, the results will shed new light on previous studies and pave the way towards a complete understanding of design-relevant processes for future devices. Moreover, the proposed methodology is by no means restrictive and will be used in future research to study related problems, such as hydrogen embrittlement in iron-based materials or defect-solute interactions in bcc metals to quantitatively characterize high-strength steels.; Multiscale modeling; Atomistic simulation; Learning on-the-fly; Discrete boundary element method; Active learning; Dislocations; Machine learning potentials; Atomistic/continuum coupling",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20100,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is largely due to the wide spectrum of possible applications, the potential to deliver multiple services (revenue stacking), and unclear market developments which make economic assessments difficult. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive cost-based analysis considering the potential role of bulk and distributed technologies for Switzerland has been performed to date that could inform a comprehensive national energy storage strategy. The objective of the proposed research project is to address this gap by performing a holistic investigation of the role of competing and/or complementary electric, thermal and chemical energy storage technologies in achieving greater penetration of renewable energy technologies and more efficient and effective use of energy in the context of the Swiss energy transition. In the first task, comprehensive, detailed and robust information and data on the status of, and prospects for, technical and cost performance of selected storage technologies will be collected to serve as a basis for an expert elicitation exercise. This will help identify drivers of future cost reduction and technical improvement, and deliver cost and performance estimates under a range of scenarios. All technologies retained after pre-screening will be characterized with a set of parameters describing these at an appropriate level of detail for techno-economic modelling and optimization.As second task, two distinct but complementary models will be developed to allow for a comprehensive investigation of energy storage in the Swiss energy transition:1.)A “single-layer model” adopting a ‘’social planner perspective” and used to identify the best mix of supply and storage technologies to achieve minimal cost or minimal energy use and/or CO2 emissions; 2.)A “double-layer model” used to investigate the influence of the dynamics of the electricity market, including long term (price, demand developments) and short/medium term (intermittent RES generation) uncertainties, and the value associated with the deployment of local energy storage capacity for different market actors in both rural and urban contexts. Finally, the third task will aim at a comparative analysis across various scenarios under the two modelling approaches, including sensitivity analysis around key boundary conditions. Conclusions will be drawn with regards to the feasibility and value proposition of a deployment of energy storage technologies at scale, of their potential role in the future of the Swiss energy system as well as of the role and implications of different policy measures.Results will be shared in the form of peer reviewed scientific papers in international journals, as well as dedicated workshops. Our close involvement in the different SCCERs will also provide opportunities to share the outcomes of the study during their respective annual conferences and/or technical workshops.

To fulfil this goal, the SHAMAN project will push the CSEM’s “tunnel-IBC” technology towards 27 % efficiency by developing (i) innovative in-situ shadow mask patterning approaches allowing to mitigate the detrimental edge effects usually occurring with this technique, and (ii) multi-layered thin film silicon-based alloys featuring a high carrier selectivity together with excellent passivation properties, hence mitigating the residual electrical losses in c-Si-based solar cells. In addition, the SHAMAN project will set up innovative diagnostic tools and adapted metrics to link the electrical and structural properties of the developed carrier selective passivated contacts to their resulting selectivity and transport losses. Tunnel-IBC devices with different sizes and shapes will be processed so as to address both the mainstream PV market and specific PV energy harvesting applications. Finally, the failure modes of tunnel-IBC devices will be investigated and mitigation measures for ensuring their 40-year lifetime warranty will be provided.As a major outcome, the SHAMAN project will demonstrate back-contacted crystalline silicon solar cells with efficiency toping 27 % at a cost of ownership on par with the current mainstream PV technologies such as PERC. As these latter feature much lower efficiencies than the tunnel-IBC devices anticipated ones, the SHAMAN project will result in a net decrease of the levelized cost of energy. The SHAMAN project will thus nurture the onset of TW scale PV deployment while offering a unique opportunity to secure the production of PV manufacturing tools in Switzerland, and more generally in Europe. Additionally, the versatility and aesthetically pleasing appearance of the tunnel-IBC technology for small size PV energy scavengers will be demonstrated, hence hooking new market opportunities. As a broader impact, the SHAMAN project will also provide the technological building blocks for the development of future PV technologies, especially multi-terminal tandems, where highly efficient back-contacted c-Si devices and tunnel junctions are required as bottom cells and are combined e.g. with perovskite top cells.

At this moment solar will likely one of the major electricity source worldwide, with the lowest costs, while contributing to mitigating CO2 emissions. Using novel materials with higher potential performance and less energy intensive processing technologies could contribute to this paradigm change. In that context, solar cell based on organo-metal trihalide perovskites are one of the most promising photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their impressive increase in initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) to currently 22.1% [1-3] in just over 6 years. This high efficiency is due to various excellent properties exhibited by the mixed organo-metal trihalide perovskites such as panchromatic absorption with very high molar extinction coefficient [4], long charge diffusion length [5], efficient charge transport and extraction [6]. These properties are linked to the crystal structure of the perovskite material, which can be tuned by adjusting composition as well as controlling nucleation and growth [7]. One of the most straightforward approaches to bring perovskite solar cells to the market lies in combining it with the market-leading silicon PV technology to form tandem solar cells with performance beyond the single-junction cell limit. Hybrid perovskite cells have been demonstrated to be highly attractive for such tandem applications as a result of their tunable band gap, high overall performance and negligible sub-bandgap absorption [4]. Here we propose to push this tandem concept further by designing novel perovskite materials and charge transporting materials with superior performances adapted to tandem integration with high-efficiency Si cells. To successfully target this ambitious goal we will 1) develop novel lead-free and stable perovskites based on non-toxic compounds with tunable absorption; 2) molecular engineer the active interfaces forming the stack by synthetizing ad hoc interfacial charge transfer layers with optimized energy level alignment and by controlling the interfacial processes therein; 3) engineer and optimize tandem structures integrating the novel perovskite materials with the high efficiency Si cell; 4) provide an in-depth fundamental understanding at different length scales, from material design to device properties, actually still missing. The approach will combine advanced materials characterization and modelling methods to guide the synthesis and provide a full understanding of the experimental findings. Within this framework, we propose a comprehensive interdisciplinary action plan based on five work packages interconnected in a holistic format. The strategy involves four partners with the unique and complementary know-how that will ensure a real breakthrough in material engineering and technological progression and a significant scientific advance in fundamental understanding.

Moreover, it stimulated the search for renewable energy sources with low production costs. This, in turn, motivated the research on the materials with a high potential for such applications. Among the primary candidates for that role are perovskite transition metal oxides (TMOs) as they are extremely flexible with respect to structural modifications and defect formation, which gives rise to a wide range of their physical properties and allows to easily manipulate them. For example, some insulating TMOs become conducting under chemical doping or thermal reduction, which is very promising in terms of potential applications in photovoltaics and thermoelectric energy conversion. However, these applications are limited at the moment as optical and transport properties of TMOs are not yet able to compete with established technology.It is well understood, that the optical and transport properties of materials are mostly defined by their electronic band structures and by the effects due to electron-phonon interaction (EPI) (for example, renormalization of the band gaps and effective masses of the charge carriers, reduced carrier mobilities and lifetimes), which, in turn, can be varied by the changes of the crystal structure. Therefore, epitaxial strain, isotropic pressure or doping can be effective tools to manipulate them. From the theory side, the effects of strain, cation substitution and formation of the oxygen vacancies on the band structures of TMOs have been investigated in the last decades using ab initio calculations. Indeed, several studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and DFT combined with many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation demonstrated that the band gap and the structure of the conduction band can be significantly affected by these structural modifications. On the other hand, their effects on the EPI and related properties of TMOs have not been studied from first principles so far due to the high complexity and prohibitive computational costs of EPI calculations for polar semiconductors.  Fortunately, the recent development of the Wannier-Fourier interpolation based formalism for calculations of the EPI enabled to estimate the electron-phonon matrix elements and related properties of different materials with high accuracy and, at the same time, with reasonable computational costs. In this project I propose to apply this powerful approach combined with DFT, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and GW to investigate the optical and transport properties of SrTiO3 (STO), which is the typical representative of TMOs, and the pathways to control these properties focusing on the effects due to EPI.

At the core of this transformational role has been the accuracy and efficiency of density-functional theory, coupled with the broad availability of robust computational codes that implement and make available to the community at large core or advanced functionalities. This accuracy and efficiency has nowadays reached the point where high-throughput simulations can routinely be employed to screen thousands of materials for optimal properties or performance. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding these successes, crucial limitations remain, and hinder accurate and efficient simulations on many materials or properties of fundamental importance for current scientific and technological applications, from energy harvesting and storage to quantum technologies. Some of these limitations are related to the accuracy of current approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation functional, while others are intrinsic to the theory itself, that, as a static functional of the local charge density, can only describe exactly (if the exact functional were known) the total energy of a system and its derivatives, precluding any access to spectroscopic information, except, at least in principle, the position of the highest occupied orbital.Overall objectives and specific aims: This research proposal aims 1) at the development, implementation, and dissemination in open-source codes of extended Hubbard functionals able to describe correctly the electronic-structure of key functional materials, such as mixed-valence oxides; 2) at the development, implementation, and dissemination of spectral functionals, such as Koopmans-compliant functionals, able to describe the spectroscopic properties of molecules and materials; and 3) at the validation and application of these advances to pressing problems in fundamental or applied materials science, chosen for their relevance as paradigmatic case studies. The project is organized into three workpackages, where researchers are coupled between development and application efforts: i) development and dissemination of extended, screened Hubbard functionals including intersite couplings; ii) development and dissemination of spectral Koopmans functionals; iii) application to core materials' projects, covering Li-ion cathode materials during charge and discharge, the structure and electronic-structure of rare-earth nickelates, and layered, exfoliable materials for photocatalytic water splitting. All applications involve collaborations with experimental partners.Methods to be used: While the advances described above are general to density-functional theory and some of its extensions, and thus open to be implemented in the many codes available today, they will be implemented and disseminated by us into the widely used open-source code Quantum ESPRESSO, connecting thus naturally to a large community of users (Web of Science records 1245 papers published in 2016, making it the most used open-source code for quantum simulations of materials). A core underlying theme will be the use of linear-response techniques based on density-functional perturbation theory, to make the calculation of the screening/gauge parameters automatic, robust, and efficient: the Hubbard on-site U and inter-site V parameters will be calculated automatically, and without the need to resort to expensive supercells' calculations, as will be the screening parameters of Koopmans-compliant functionals. The importance of this effort should not be underestimated, notwithstanding the priority of the scientific goals (i.e.~of having functionals able to descrive difficult materials or novel properties): by providing reliable and robust protocols for the determination of these quantities, and verified and validated codes that can exploit the power of these functionals, these developments become part of a true ``open science'' portfolio of community tools.Expected results and their impact: First and foremost, the developments described above would bring accuracy and efficiency to the study of the electronic structure of complex materials, with functionals tuned to the response functions of the system at hand, bypassing the need of more expensive (and somehow less satisfactory) hybrid functionals, with also the capability to describe spectroscopic properties (remarkably, the performance of Koopmans' functionals is comparable or even slightly superior to the state-of-the-art in diagrammatic techniques, a much more involved and computationally expensive effort). The applications chosen highlight the shortcomings of current approaches, and hint at the vast class of functional materials that could be addressed with such techniques.

The intermittent nature of these energy sources requires suitable energy storage technology to be able to align the “production” with the “demand” of energy. While battery technology for mobile applications shows continuous progress, the storage and re-conversion of electricity in the form of energy carriers such as hydrogen gas still faces significant challenges. Complementing strategies to utilize renewable energy for the production of gases, liquids or chemicals of interest, summarized under the “Power to value” or “Power2X” label, are even more in their technological infancy. However, for an efficient regenerative energy management on a global scale such technologies are indispensable.For all these technologies a fundamental understanding and rational design of (electro-)catalysts, on which many surface reactions of interest take place, play an essential role. In state-of-the-art academic electrocatalyst design, the focus is on optimizing the surface structure of the catalyst on a nanometer scale. This design principle, however, only takes kinetic factors into account - which are important, but for not sufficient for catalytic applications. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performance is determined at significant lower reaction rates than required for applications. We propose here a research program that focuses on a different, complementary design approach for supported electrocatalysts in order to optimize their properties. In supported electrocatalysts, the active phase consists of metal or alloy nanoparticles distributed over a conducting support, mostly carbon based. Our aim is to elucidate the role of mesoscopic properties - such as the interparticle distance on the support - for their performance in a comprehensive and systematic manner by combining electrochemical measurements with (ex-situ and in operando) spectroscopy and microscopy. Mesoscopic properties have so far received only little attention in academic electrocatalyst design, yet some few studies demonstrate that they bear significant potential for improving the electrocatalyst performance. A proof of concept has been our pioneering work on the particle proximity effect on size-selected Pt clusters. Different colloidal catalyst synthesis strategies developed by us, allow the investigation of mesoscopic effects with a significantly broader perspective.The project is divided into three complementary parts studying mesoscopic effects with regard to i) fundamental properties of electrocatalysts in an electrochemical environment, ii) their electrocatalytic performance for different energy conversion reactions, and iii) their degradation behavior. The investigations are performed under conditions, close to realistic applications and it is expected that a successful project will significantly broaden the perspectives and design principles of supported electrocatalysts.; electrocatalyst design; mesoscopic properties; electrocatalysis; energy conversion",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the process of anaerobic fermentation of biomass, the bio based renewable chemical compound methane is produced, which is then used to drive combusting engines for electricity production or to run vehicles. The converted degraded substrate is a low value waste product commonly used as manure. The low value is based on the transport effort that decreases the economy of the biogas plants. Ideas with solid and liquid separation of the excessive nutrient surplus lead to efficient nutrient separation. However, new additional markets for digestate products such as the herewith proposed will open new routes for digestate disposal as alternative biocide source. Universities and companies (Syngenta, DuPond, Marone Bioinovation, BioAtlantis and others) are searching the world for new biocidic substances. Coral reefs, seaweed meadows or microbial toxins are scouted for new chemical structures with potential biocidal functions. Organisms found to produce the compounds of choice are cultured in huge fermentators to produce the desired chemical substances. In this sense, biogas plants are huge fermentators with a wide range of unknown substances produced in the digestates. The number of biogas plants has been increased rapidly, leading to environmental and economic benefits within rural areas. Therefore, large amounts of anaerobic digestate have been generated as a by-product during the biogas production. The digestate is generally rich in macronutrients and mainly destined to be used as fertilizers in agriculture. However, the application of digestate in order to supply nutrients to the plants has shown to play an essential role in the inhibition of plant pathogens. Farmers have observed that the application of the digestate promotes control against  diseases in plants. The exact mechanism of promoting the resistance to disease by the digestate is not well understood, but one speculates that bioactive compounds with biocide activities against soil pathogens are responsible to promote disease resistance. Since there is very little progress in identifying and characterizing these bioactive molecules in the digestate, we see a great opportunity in developing a new area of research for biopesticides. By fractionating the liquid digestate using a combination of liquid-liquid extractions and a series of chromatographic techniques (e.g. anion/cation exchange, reverse phase and gel permeation), fractions will be evaluated for their nematicidal properties against the economically important and wide spread root knot nematode Meloidogyne spp.. To achieve the main objective, the specific aims are to: 1) Develop, optimize and validate green-based and cost-effective fractionation and purification techniques; 2) Assess the nematicidal properties of the extracted biomolecules. The nematicidal properties will be validated by using in vitro approaches. 3) Characterize the structure of the compounds with good nematicidal properties. The bioactive compounds will be identified and quantified using chemical-analytical procedures (GC-MS, HPLC-MS and ESI-MS analysis). We believe that the identified compounds can provide evidences for renewable crop protection products, rather than relying on petrochemical pesticides. The discovery of crop protection has traditionally been the exclusive domain of private industry, and the role of Universities and Research Institutes is usually limited to the evaluation of new products for industry. However, we believe that with the expertise and facilities at hand at the host research Institute, we have a unique opportunity to do more than just evaluating new products for the crop protection industry.; Biogas digestate; Nematicide; Active compounds",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,30200,20700,NA,NA,NA,NA

Electrocatalytic water splitting offers an environmentally clean pathway to hydrogen generation that can be carried out at room temperature using renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro). Water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER), as part of electrolysis, requires highly oxidizing conditions and can damage the surface of the catalyst. Perovskite oxides are among the most active and chemically versatile OER electrocatalysts. However, such compositional versatility of perovskites results in a complex thermodynamic phase diagram that makes a controlled surface preparation difficult. During OER, highly oxidizing potentials can drive electrochemical structural degradation of such surfaces, which typically proceeds via cation leaching, oxidation of transition metals and dissolution, oxygen intercalation, and amorphization, which eventually leads to the degradation of their performance. A lack of fundamental understanding of how the perovskite synthesis pathway correlates with the resulting surface structure and composition and which mechanism drives its electrochemical degradation poses a significant challenge to the development of stable and active electrocatalysts.Herein, the overall goal of the project is to develop fundamental understanding of the surface formation pathways during a high-temperature synthesis and how the surface imperfection and heterogeneity defines its anodic stability and OER activity. The project is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on spatiotemporal studies of the synthesis at nanoscale and the second part addresses the structural evolution during OER at the nanoscale. The competitive advantage of these studies is in (i) employment of both real materials (nanoparticles) and their model analogues (thin films) and (ii) the focus on the local tracking of the structural and chemical evolution on the nanoscale using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Because many perovskite oxides have a complex thermodynamic phase diagram that makes a controlled surface preparation difficult, they are ideally suited for the proposed studies from both fundamental and practical point of view: 1. During a high-temperature synthesis of perovskite nanoparticles, we expect a complex interplay between the kinetics and thermodynamics which can result in an oxide surface that is chemically and structurally heterogeneous and different from the bulk of the particle. By directly observing nanoscale variation in composition and structure using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we will study how the kinetically limited processes during the synthesis of perovskites can lead to the appearance of impurity phases and structural heterogeneity at the surface. For TEM experiments with oxide thin films, we will implement an elegant way of preparing TEM specimens that will allow us to preserve the surface of single-crystalline films.2. We will quantitatively analyze the nanoscale structural and chemical evolution of the perovskite electrocatalysts during water oxidation reaction and investigate its connection to their electrocatalytic activity. By employing both nanoparticles and single-crystalline films, we will be able to bridge the gap between the “real” electrocatalysts and “model” electrocatalytic surfaces. Specifically, through Identical-Location TEM imaging of single-crystalline flakes, we will track the OER-induced local structural evolution of the perovskite surface with well-defined facets and chemistry. The results of the proposed studies will extend far beyond the area of electrocatalysis and become a large step forward in establishing the role of nanoscale phenomena in the diffusion-driven equilibration of multicomponent systems. These studies will also significantly deepen our understanding of the electrocatalyst surface evolution during severe oxidation and simplify the correlation of the experiments with existing models of the solid-liquid interface and adsorbate energetics.; Oxide; Microscopy; Electrocatalysis; Oxidation; Films; Structure",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both bulk anisotropic carrier transport dynamics and surface defects will be characterized with exclusively available instruments. Spectroscopic understanding on crystallographic-dependent carrier dynamics and surface defect management will, in turn, guide the rational design of photocathode materials beyond the state-of-the-art.

To further improve the total cycle efficiency, we focus on the consumption side: in this project, we aim to exploit catalytically induced luminescence (cataluminescence) to develop a novel fuel-to-electricity device with increased efficiency going beyond that of thermoluminescence devices. First experiments are promising, however, the measured cataluminescence from combustion of MeOH on metallic surfaces indicates that the relevant catalytic process takes place mainly on the metallic particle, i.e. the sought non-thermal energy transfer takes place on such metallic particle - oxide systems to a minor extent only and the corresponding efficiencies remain low. To improve the cataluminescent system, we will study the dependence of the energy transfer on the electronic state of the system using the peculiar properties of catalytically active quaternary perovskites such as RExTi0.95Ni0.05O3-d d, containing rare-earth ions (RE) with tailored luminescence. The system is known to be non-conducting in oxidized state, but exsolutes Ni onto the surface upon reduction at high temperature. Thus, we are able to manipulate the metallic state and investigate its influence on the catalytic as well as luminescent properties. The choice of rare earth elements is governed by luminescence energy. The goal of the project is to lay the foundation for a novel energy conversion device with a potential efficiency well above the established state-of-the-art. We strive mainly to enhance scientific knowledge by providing fundamental insight into the phenomenon of cataluminescence and combustion catalysis that can be transferred into other fields. However, we also envision industrial / commercial impact of the resulting device.

This method relies on semiconductors (e.g., TiO2) and co-catalysts (e.g., Au, Pt) to directly obtain hydrogen from water and sunlight. Great effort has been devoted to optimizing the selection of semiconductor/co-catalyst couples. However, the efficiency of the process does not depend on the photocatalyst alone. Hydrogen production necessitates in fact the transport of matter and light through three phases: solid, liquid, and gas. As a result, the efficiency of the overall process is often limited by mass transfer. To date, most reactor designs utilize photocatalytic particles and thus rely on liquid-to-particle mass transfer. Optimizing the latter, while ensuring that the particles are well irradiated, is challenging. In other chemical reactors, liquid-to-particle mass transfer is routinely enhanced by externally imposing flows through stirrers or pumps. Yet for particulate water-splitting reactors, this strategy is often impractical or inefficient. We propose an alternative strategy that obviates the need for externally imposed flows while ensuring high mass transfer rates in photocatalytic water-splitting reactors. Our proposal relies on a reverse strategy suggested by a seemingly unrelated field of research: that of active colloids, also known as microrobots. Microrobots are particles that move autonomously and efficiently through liquids, by converting available “fuel” (e.g. light or chemicals) into net propulsion. By doing so, they set the surrounding fluid into motion, and thus can potentially serve as “microstirrers” to enhance mass transport. We therefore propose to engineer microrobots that power their motion solely by water splitting. In other words, we propose a reactor concept that employs particles with the dual-functionality of catalyst and “stirrer”.To test the proposed strategy, we will advance the state-of-the-art by demonstrating the scalable synthesis of photocatalytic water-splitting microrobots, and by studying their light-induced motion and catalytic activity. To that end, we will selectively decorate one side of mesoporous microspheres of TiO2 with noble-metal co-catalyst nanoparticles. We will do so by adapting a method that can process large quantities of microspheres: the Pickering wax emulsion method. Breaking the symmetry in the catalytic activity of the TiO2 microspheres will enable autonomous motion via two mechanisms: (1) net momentum imparted by asymmetric bubble formation, detachment, burst, and collapse; and (2) self-diffusiophoresis driven by local chemical gradients. The synergistic combination of the high surface area of mesoporous TiO2 and the activity of the co-catalyst will be crucial to the onset of bubble-driven propulsion, which inherently enhances mixing.If successful, this multidisciplinary project will have an impact on fields spanning energy storage, chemical reaction engineering, colloidal science, and transport phenomena. This work can lead not only to more efficient processes for photocatalytic water-splitting, but also to an altogether new class of chemical reactors. In particular, the material platform described here (asymmetric mesoporous microspheres/co-catalysts) lends itself to a wide range of other relevant reactions. Finally, this work could also inspire fundamental studies on the complex interplay between the collective motion of catalytic microrobots and the chemical and flow fields they generate.; photocatalysis; active colloids; mass transfer; chemical reactors; hydrodynamics; microrobots; micro-mixing; water splitting",2,1,Collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,20400,NA,NA,NA

Building stocks in Switzerland use more than 40% of the overall energy demand in Switzerland and more than 32% of the electricity demand in the country. In order to reduce the energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, buildings need to become much more energy efficient and the energy demand should be primarily (increasingly) satisfied through renewable energy resources (e.g. solar energy, wind micro-turbine, and geothermal heat pumps). Forecasting renewable energy potential for the built environment, therefore, is becoming an important issue, particularly for municipalities, building owners, and energy suppliers so as to obtain meaningful information regarding potential energy generation and potential energy saving. However, the stochastic nature of the energy resources (particularly solar and wind), massive amounts of heterogeneous, semi-structured and unstructured data generated at unprecedented scale, as well as the complexity of disparate data sources make it extremely challenging to forecast spatio-temporal potential of renewable energy resources. This includes high dimensional complex environmental data as well as massive cloud of LiDAR point data for measuring an entire built environment (buildings, trees, and landscape). Data-driven approaches and machine learning algorithms will play an important role to overcome these challenges. Given this context, the project aims at (i) estimating hybrid renewable energy potential in the built environment, rather than focusing on stand-alone energy potential, in order to mitigate the effects of variability in the individual energy resources and improve the reliability of the power generation, (ii) developing machine learning algorithms for spatio-temporal environmental data processing and analysis as well as for LiDAR point cloud urban dataset classification, (iii) applying the developed algorithms based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), to the built environment for predicting energy generation and potential energy savings of hybrid renewable resources, (iv) analysing the forecasting models according to the projected climate scenarios for 2035 and 2050, (v) uncertainty estimations and model validation using measurement data from weather stations and energy provider companies (e.g. EPFL campus, Geneva, Zurich, Basel), (vi) proposing Building Renewable Energy Database (BRED), geo-visualisation tools and renewable energy mapping to support evidence-based decision-making processes.; Built environment; Hybrid renewable energy; Forecasting and uncertainty; Sustainability; Machine learning; Intelligent decision-making; LiDAR point cloud",3,1,Collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,20500,NA,10300,NA,NA,20400

It investigates the factors constituting public perceptions toward policy interventions that are needed to transition to sustainable development, but which at the same time also transform the existing social contract. More specifically, this research program considers energy taxation and subsidy reform in countries where citizens and businesses are used to rely on cheap fossil-fuel based energy. Energy policy reforms are at the heart of many economic developmental policies and are widely heralded as necessary for sustainable development. In such 'social contract jurisdictions', however, high energy subsidies and low energy taxation also constitute industrial policy and remain a pivotal method to guarantee a certain standard of public welfare. Currently, there is a lack of academic research on what exactly constitutes public perceptions, how they change, and what their impact on policy processes exactly may be.This research program aims at zooming out and filling that void. I will answer three research questions:1) What determines citizens' perceptions to governmental attempts to introduce policies aimed at energy taxation and subsidy reform, but which also significantly affect the existing social contract? 2) What determines coping decisions of private sector stakeholders confronted with new energy-related costs and that affect citizens via the passing-through of such costs or downsizing employment? 3) How do changing perceptions impact the ability of government to transform a social contract by implementing medium-term policies aimed at energy policy reform?My theoretical framework relies on the rich literature on perceptions toward tax morale and tax reform. There is currently no theory on public perceptions and subsidy reforms. This is a void I intend to fill. I identified six explanatory variables: economic burden, knowledge & complexity, fiscal exchange, social & individual norms, governmental legitimacy and participation & voice. The research plan explains in depth how these variables are measured. I make use of a mixed method research design that I apply to case studies in India (Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan), Iraq (Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan), Nigeria and Egypt.

Many studies show that policy intervention is needed to re-direct and accelerate TC. However, the literature is far from having reached consensus on which policy instruments, designs and portfolios have what innovation effects, and which scope of policy change is necessary to alter the rate and direction of TC. Besides these open questions, the feedback effect of TC on policy dynamics and thus policy change is hardly analyzed, despite the recognized existence of this effect. An example of a feedback effect would be the evolution of a new technology that empowers new actors and thereby alters the actor constellations and thus the policy dynamics, ultimately resulting in policy change. While evolutionary economic literature highlights the co-evolution of technology and institutions (such as policy), the role of politics in moderating this co-evolution has not been analyzed in great detail. Only a few isolated studies exist that endogenize technological change in the field of policy studies. With the present proposal we aim at opening the black box of the co-evolution of technology and policy by combining insights from evolutionary economics and political science. More specifically, our research framework covers three elements - politics, policy and technological change - and their interactions: the policy dynamics (politics acting on policy), the policy effects (resulting in technological change) and the feedback of technological change on policy dynamics. In order to analyze these interactions we propose to develop new ways to empirically assess policy change in a systematic way, apply them in statistical analyses, conduct in-depth case studies, and develop an evolutionary simulation model. We focus on the energy sector - a sector in which technological change is socially desirable and substantially influenced by public policy. Yet, our innovative proposal can generate theoretical and methodological implications that can be generalized to other contexts. We aim to derive recommendations for policy makers. Anticipating the feedback effects of technological change on the dynamics of the policy making process can help design more sustainable and long-term efficient policy portfolios at an early stage.

These materials have been recently recognized as promising candidates for energy-efficient novel technological applications but they are typically restricted to perovskite-related structures, a limiting factor for their integration in semiconductor electronics.The recent and unexpected discovery of room-temperature electric hysteresis loops in ultrathin (Hf1-xZrx)O2 (HZO) heterostructures marked the appearance of both ferroelectric (FE) and AFE binary oxides. Here, a significant distinction from conventional ferroic perovskites is that the dielectric order in HZO emerges exclusively at the nanoscale. Therefore, also considering their easier implementation with silicon, it is worth investigating HZO ultrathin films from both a technological and a fundamental point of view. In particular, HZO films undergo through a paraelectric (PE) to FE to AFE phase transition with increasing Zr content. The primary objective of the proposal is to investigate the AFE state in phase-pure epitaxially-grown ZrO2 ultrathin films. Exploring the nature and the limits of this peculiar AFE state, non-existent in the bulk, is the first step towards integrating it into more functional concepts.

In the light of the growing world population, it is desirable to switch these processes to a renewable non-food competitive carbon source. One carbon source that has recently attracted increasing interest in this regard is the one-carbon compound methanol. A variety of organisms, the so-called methylotrophs, is naturally able to use methanol as sole source of carbon and energy. Methylobacterium extorquens has been studied from a fundamental perspective for over five decades. Even though, its suitability for the bioconversion of methanol into valuable products has been illustrated by a handful of studies, engineering novel products remains challenging. This is mostly due to major differences in metabolism compared to established production hosts and the lack of knowledge of the operating regulatory networks to predict the effect of extensive modifications. The goal of the proposed project will be to engineer M. extorquens for the production of two new valuable chemicals from methanol.The initial goal is the establishment of lactate production. Lactate and its derivatives have different applications for example as a building block of bioplastics or as ingredients of cosmetics. A second goal is the production of the aromatic compound para-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), which relies on a more complex synthesis pathway. Establishing high flux through this metabolic route is an excellent starting point for the generation of a wide selection of aromatic compounds with only minor modification of the pathway. Aromatic compounds have a wide range of applications including polymer production or as preservatives. Many of them are currently derived from petrochemicals. The design of the production pathways will be guided by in silico modeling using a genome-scale metabolic model of the organism. Subsequent optimization of the yield will be achieved by experimental characterization of the strain to identify bottlenecks and subsequent modelling to predict optimal targets.

This represents a phenomenal growth rate compared to today´s total installed capacity of about 600 GW (for reference, the capacity added last year was about 140 GW). In this project, we will bring our flash infrared annealing (FIRA) technique for the curing of thin-film materials to the next level by demonstrating a rapid and continuous process with low environmental impact for the production of high-efficiency PV devices. We will apply our method to upscale and accelerate process time of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells, a solar cell technology that has the potential to accelerate the deployment of PV thanks to its potential for high performance and low fabrication costs.

Importantly, our approach has about only 10% of the environmental impact compared to the most established antisolvent (AS) method based on life cycle assessments. FIRA has hence a unique potential for industrial manufacturing since it can be adapted for both plate-to-plate and roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, and it replaces hour-long annealing steps. In the project, we will upgrade and generalize our FIRA method to manufacture large-scale perovskite single-junction and perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. We will ensure that our process is rapid, environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and enables the continuous manufacturing process of thin films and devices of high optoelectronic quality.

However, their intermittent nature necessitates the simultaneous development of high energy density, low-cost energy storage systems.

Although the research on the Li-S batteries have been going for almost two decades, there are still fundamental problems yet to be tackled. The problems include (1) insulating nature of elemental sulfur, sulfur reduction intermediates and Li2S, (2) dendrite formation on the Li-metal anode surface, (3) volume expansion during lithiation up 80% and (4) the dissolution of Li-polysulfides (Li-PS) in the electrolyte, which serves as a redox shuttle leading to a severe capacity decay.  Among these issues, the most critical one is the dissolution of Li-PS in the electrolyte and its diffusion as well as the side reactions with Li-metal anode and the electrolyte. Li-S battery can be considered as a liquid battery due to the dissolution of sulfur following electrochemical reduction, in which the electrolyte is acting as a “catholyte”. While the Li-PS shuttling can be managed at low sulfur loadings, it is more difficult to do so at high sulfur loadings, which is essentially required to realize full potential of Li-S battery. The strategies to mitigate Li-PS shuttling include the trapping in the electrode, blocking from interlayers and introducing catalysts capable of converting Li-PS into Li2S. While these approaches led to improved capacity within the first few cycles, subsequent fast capacity decay was also observed. In this project, in order to address these above mentioned challenges and also to establish fundamental understanding on the interaction of Li-PS with electrode components, we are proposing to develop dual targeting approach using smart polymeric materials to mitigate Li-PS shuttling. Our approach is three fold; (1) the development of defect engineered polymers via in-situ sulfur mediated polymerization, in which the defects will constitute either soft organic cations to interact with sulfur anion or glycol chains/crown ethers to target Li ions. These defects will allow us to confine the Li-PS within the active material. Importantly, the in-situ synthesized polymers will have high conductivity, thus facilitating efficient conversion of Li-PS into the insoluble Li2S due to the proximity of Li-PS to the conducting backbone. (2) We will explore catalytically active coating materials on the separator, which will act as a “smart filter” to recognize Li-PS and readily convert to insoluble Li2S. (3) Finally, we will integrate first two approaches to realize dual-capture mechanism  for Li-PS at the smart polymer cathode as well as by interlayer blocking in order to realize the high performance and long life Li-S battery. For every part of this project, we will carry out detailed in-situ and ex-situ analysis to understand the operating mechanism and probe the interaction of Li-PS. These findings will allow us to establish fundamental understating on the mechanism and thus establish design principles for further development of Li-S battery components. ; Energy Storage; Polysulfide shuttling; Li-ion Battery; Sulfur; Polymerization",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are, however, several barriers to achieve the full energy efficiency potential of the Swiss building sector. Several explanations can explain this apparent Swiss Energy Efficiency Gap. Some are specific to Switzerland. For instance, Switzerland has a very heterogeneous building stock with old and new buildings dispersed among rural and urban areas, a very high rate of renters and a high cost of labor and materials. Other explanations, which have been found to be important in other contexts are that the market for energy-efficient retrofits and buildings is plagued with informational problems. Homeowners face high search and hassle costs to find relevant information about home retrofits, to find trusted suppliers of services, and to verify the quality of the work that has been done. Meanwhile, suppliers face high customer acquisition costs, and barriers to credibly disclose their expertise and skills related to energy efficiency projects. Finally, government entities, such as Swiss cities and cantons, have limited tools to leverage information that would allow them to track, forecast, and target their energy efficiency efforts in their respective jurisdiction.  The main motivation of this project is that informational problems in the market for energy-efficient retrofits and buildings act as important barriers to investments. The goal of this research project is to demonstrate than online marketplaces can play an important role in addressing the information problems that consumers, suppliers of energy efficiency services, and local governments face in this market - and ultimately to encourage cost-effective investments in energy efficiency technologies. Combining the disciplines of economics, information technology and data science, the project will develop a prototype online marketplace designed to address multidimensional information problems. The effectiveness of the marketplace will be assessed with large-scale experiments deployed in Switzerland. This project will be the first research effort in Switzerland, but also more broadly, to investigate the role of the digital economy, and in particular an online marketplace, in addressing information problems that impeded investments in energy-efficient buildings. This project will inform the research on the Energy Efficiency Gap, and the design of novel energy efficiency policies in Switzerland and elsewhere. The main features of the online marketplace that will be developed as part of this project are the following:1.A marketplace where homeowners can search and request services for energy efficiency audit experts, architects, builders, general contractors, and civil engineers;2.Pricing schemes that use simple online auctions;3.Reputation mechanisms for suppliers of energy efficiency services; and4.A dashboard of energy efficiency projects for government entities.The effectiveness of the overall marketplace and of specific features will be investigated with sound experimental designs on a representative sample of the Swiss population.  ; Online Marketplace; Swiss Building Sector; Energy Efficiency Gap; Economic Market Design",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,10700,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

Strategies for the transition place high expectations in efficiency and technology to reach emission reduction targets. In other words, decarbonization should primarily be met through energy efficiency measures and technological changes. This relies on the premises that more efficient uses of energy lead to reduction of emissions. However, a growing body of research shows that response to efficiency reduces the expected energy savings and that the overall contributions of technical measures are more relative than absolute. So called rebound effects results from respending of the monetary savings from energy efficiency. As such, research has focused on the elasticities of demand to estimate direct and indirect rebound effects. Moreover, household consumption has received comparatively more attention than industrial activities and services despite a large energy saving potential. Therefore, this project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the changes induced by energy efficiency measures at the level of industrial activities and especially services.This project innovates by uncovering potential threshold effects in energy uses which have been observed by very few but promising studies on energy conservation at the household level. Elasticities may not be the most adequate measure of rebound, as lexicographic preferences and strategic choices prevail in decision making beyond a given point. The objective of this project is to identify and quantify such thresholds in the energy use of industrial activities and services for absolute reductions. These findings could lead to extremely useful results in setting up accompanying measures which mitigate the undesirable effects of energy efficiency.More specifically, this project will decompose energy use according to determinant factors and per energy agent, separating renewable energy from emission relevant sources. Efficiency gains will be contrasted with the structural effects of deindustrialization and the increasingly large share of services in Switzerland and Europe. Hence the embodied energy in trade will also be quantified to control for any shifting of energy use abroad. The direct and indirect effects of efficiency will be estimated with input output based models before any thresholds in energy consumption can be identified. In addition to mitigating rebound effects, the results of this project will yield new indicators of energy (in)dependence upon trade as well as total energy intensity.; Decompositions analysis; Embodied energy; Energy efficiency; Threshold effects; Structural changes; Energy indicators",1,0,Non-collaborative,4,1,More than one discipline,20500,10700,20700,NA,NA,20100

Specifically, this project will investigate unconventional conduction phenomena in solids, addressing fundamental questions on: (i) the quantum origin of the plateau appearing universally in the temperature-thermal conductivity curve of amorphous solids at cryogenic temperatures (below 30 K), and its correlation with the other universal feature of disordered systems, the “boson peak” in the vibrational density of states [1]; (ii) the microscopic physics underlying the high-temperature (above 400K) trend of the ultralow thermal conductivity of amorphous (disordered) solids; (iii) the conditions under which charge and heat transfer becomes “hydrodynamic” (i.e. the charge or heat flow is akin to the flow of a viscous fluid, assuming a Poiseuille-like profile or even forming vortices [2-7]), and the potential existence of hydrodynamic synergies and composite excitations involving charge and heat carriers.These unconventional transport phenomena could potentially be very relevant for several technological applications, including electronics, thermal insulation, and renewable energy production. In fact, electronic devices' overheating is the main limiting factor for their miniaturization and efficiency, and the emergence of heat hydrodynamics, where heat transfer is fluid-like (rather than diffusive) and very fast, could be exploited to solve this problem. Moreover, heat-insulating materials are highly interesting to the aerospace industry e.g. to shield spaceships from extreme temperatures. Finally, the research done in this proposal could be potentially very relevant for renewable energies, exposing strategies to lower the thermal conductivity of disordered thermoelectric materials used to generate electricity from waste heat, and thus increase their thermoelectric-conversion efficiency.References:[1] V.

190259,07,Spark,2019,ETH Domain,Other disciplines of Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences,Projects,98240,TRUE,Recovery of critical metals and rare earth elements from electronic waste using bio-mining processes (E-waste biomining),Electronic waste; Waste management; Bacterial consortia; Rare earth elements; Bio-mining; Recycling,"The advent of sophisticated albeit short-lifespan electronic devices triggers the accumulation of millions of tons of hazardous electronic waste (e-waste) on a global scale (Veit & Bernardes, 2015; Zhang & Xu, 2016; Mmereki, 2016). Switzerland alone produced 213’000 tons of electrical and electronical equipment waste in 2014 (Kusch & Hills, 2017). Breivik et al. (2014) suggested that 23 % of e-waste generated in developed countries are being nowadays shipped to non-developed African nations, China and India principally, where these products are being dumped without proper rules and are likely to induce massive environmental problems (Amankwah-Amoah, 2016). A small proportion only of these e-waste is recycled currently (Mmereki, 2016), despite the presence of substantial amounts of precious metals and valuable material (Zhang & Xu, 2016) such as so-called Rare-Earth Elements (REEs). Main forms of recycling processes applied to e-waste involve pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. The heterogeneity of the raw material, the energy consumption and the generation of secondary pollution sources are the main reasons why these methods are not giving satisfaction to date (Pryia and Hait, 2017a). Furthermore the discharge of large volumes of lixiviates poses a serious threat to the environment (Qiu et al., 2008).The goal of this project is to develop a relatively simple and efficient technique for the recycling of valuable metals from e-waste such as printed board circuits (PCB) using microbe-based bio-leaching activities. Microbe-mediated metal bioleaching involves the conversion of metallic compounds into soluble states through the activity of acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. Well-known acidophilic bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus spp., Leptospirillum spp. and Sulfolobus spp. are known for their bioleaching capacities (Priya & Hait, 2017b). Yet, and although bioleaching technology has reached a stage of maturity in the mining industry, including full scale operations, techniques developed so far for the implementation on e-waste are still in infancy. Despite numerous trials, techniques developed to date suffer from major weaknesses linked with the accumulation of metals in solution, reaching toxic concentrations, and suboptimal leaching rates. However, the major flaw however consists possibly in the design and the optimization of single strain microorganisms for this complex biotechnological purpose. While this reductionist approach offers definite advantages in terms of simplicity, use of pure bacterial cultures creates a situation that rarely takes place in nature (Cavaliere et al., 2017). Systems design in this way are fragile by essence. On the contrary, highly diversified microbial communities display natural competences, such as mutualism and commensalism that eventually lead to improved performance and stability (Evans et al., 2017). Preliminary studies and bioleaching experiments carried out to date by our team demonstrated the potential of complex bacterial communities in laboratory conditions. Elements such as cobalt, lithium, aluminum, copper, as well as REEs such as indium, neodymium and dysprosium were retrieved efficiently from e-waste made up of mobile phones. The effectiveness is still relative with respect to the recovery of gallium, silver and gold. Nevertheless, these initial experiments showed that this biological process does not require important amounts of energy and does not produce harmful gas emissions. These experiments were carried out at standard temperature and atmospheric pressure, without the need for environmentally damaging reagents, producing low amounts of secondary pollution.In this project, the aim is to assess the capacity of complex acidophilic microbial communities for the bio-leaching of e-waste, using conditions approaching those required for industrial full-scale operations. This study follows three goals, such as i) the isolation of efficient acidophilic metal-oxydizing bacterial consortia ii) the building of a low-cost and scalable biotrickling fermenters for e-waste leaching, and finally iii) the running of this fermenter in continuous mode, with efficient metal leaching. Analysis involve amplicon sequencing of the communities and detailed chemical characterization of the leachate composition. Finally, this bioleaching technique would contribute to the management of important metal resources and strategic components, which are required for the development of a society based on energy saving strategies and durable energy resources.; Electronic waste; Waste management; Bacterial consortia; Rare earth elements; Bio-mining; Recycling",2,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20700,30100,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the implementation of respective infrastructure projects has proven to be difficult and slow, not least due to political opposition and actors’ reluctance to invest in according projects. These challenges have been intensively discussed in the research on social acceptance of renewable energy infrastructure (RET), where infrastructure for renewable energy production has been the focus of many studies (e.g., Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont 2021; Tabi and Wüstenhagen 2017; Walter 2014 for the Swiss case). Seasonal or long-term thermal energy storages (STES) are another central element of the energy transition, which - as we will elaborate below - are similarly affected by acceptance and related diffusion problems but have so far received much less public as well as scientific attention. This is the starting point of the present project, in which we ask the overarching research question of how to achieve a breakthrough of long-term thermal energy storage in the residential sector in Switzerland. Seasonal thermal energy storages (STES) are used to transfer heat from summer to winter for heating purposes, the latter contributing by 39.6% to the total final energy use in Switzerland (BfE 2019). Introducing a higher share of renewable energy sources, the Swiss energy system needs more flexibility by means of additional energy storage capacities. With sectoral coupling between heating and electricity, STES present an alternative storage solution to batteries, which are environmentally challenging, and to pumped hydropower, which is already at its limits. STES are capable of providing massive storage capacities at low costs to the energy system. While other countries like Denmark have largely invested in STES, Switzerland’s dissemination of STES reduces to few demonstration type installations. As we argue, the problem is not about a lack of technological solutions. In fact, various technologies for STES, which differ substantially in terms of costs, materials, energy densities, and risks, are (potentially) available. However, despite their existence, these technological solutions have not yet made the breakthrough on the market. Thereby, the key to diffusion of a certain technology goes beyond its mere economic viability. Hence, for STES to contribute to the Swiss energy transition, we need to find ways to overcome the current gap between the availability of technological solutions and their non-diffusion at the user side and look at the technology acceptance in more detail. This is where our project has breakthrough potential. More precisely, the planned project generates important advancement for STES implementation at two levels: First, it sheds light on STES from a social acceptance perspective and, in particular, provides the first systematic analysis of actors’ preferences towards STES in Switzerland. This is crucial against the background that different actor groups (e.g., population, energy operators, architects, property owner companies, political actors, administrations etc.) are relevant for the diffusion of STES and may at the same time play different roles and have different views and preferences regarding STES implementation (Dermont et al. 2017). Our underlying assumption is that the awareness of the importance of the thermal energy sector within the energy system transition in general and of the value of STES technologies in particular is generally low (McKenna et al. 2019), which - in combination with actors’ heterogeneity - makes successful STES implementation even more challenging. Systematic knowledge about actor segmentation and the role of information allows formulating recommendations about how to sensitize actor groups for STES implementation, and generates insights on how to integrate these actor groups into technology development. Second, to bridge the gap between technology development and social acceptance, we propose and conduct a novel way to integrate stakeholder preferences into technology assessment, and thereby further develop the “constructive technology assessment” (CTA) approach. We combine up-to-date political science methods with a technological modularization approach, which enables us - in contrast to previous CTA approaches - to integrate stakeholder preferences in a much more systematic and empirically sound way and to take the heterogeneity of stakeholders into account. At the technological side, we consider STES technologies of different technology readiness levels such as water tanks, pit storages and borehole fields and technologies based on chemical reactions and phase transitions. In particular, we newly conceptualize combined technology approaches, which allow for a modular tailoring of characteristics based on the socio-technological feedbacks. We expect that the outcomes of the proposed project will provide important insights for the breakthrough of STES in Switzerland.; Conjoint experiment; Seasonal thermal energy storage; Constructive Technology Assessment; Technology selection/development ; Sensible Thermal Storage; Information effects; Energy storage; Thermochemical Thermal Storage; Social acceptance; Latent Thermal Storage; Energy System Analysis",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,NA,20500,10600,NA,NA,NA

As with other promising renewable energy technologies, also for PEMFC cost is still a major hurdle for the large-scale commercialization and substantial impact on the energy system. The main challenge is the reduction of the platinum loading in the catalyst layers that makes about 50% of stack cost in high volume production scenarios.Today’s technology is still a factor of 2-3 away from US-DoE’s goal for passenger cars of less than ~0.1 gPt/kW stack power. Because the goal seems difficult to reach with increased activity of Pt( alloy) or non-noble-metal catalysts, it is therefore aspired to reduce the transport resistances in order to achieve the required high-current density performance.It is the overall goal of this project to develop porous layers in PEMFC with drastically reduced transport losses in the gas and ionomer phases and thus to push the PEM-technology to its full potential. This is achieved through materials development and porous layer design guided by advanced diagnostics and characterization. In this approach, three different catalyst layer material concepts are addressed: i) low loaded Pt( alloy) on carbon catalyst based electrodes with ~10 ?m thickness. This material is the incumbent technology; however it is at risk not to fulfill the cost goal. Therefore the less mature material concept of ii) thin (~1 2 ?m), low loaded Pt( alloy) aerogel catalyst based electrodes, and the far reaching approach of iii) thick (>50 ?m) non-noble-metal catalyst based electrodes will be pursued. With their different composition and up to two orders of magnitude difference in thickness, the three catalyst layer concepts require different structural optimization. For optimum water management at high current densities, catalyst layers need to be combined with specifically adapted micro-porous layers (MPL). MPLs are therefore the fourth component developed in the project to design membrane electrode combinations with optimal transport properties fulfilling cost and durability goals.The preparation, characterization, optimization and testing of the three inherently different catalyst layers and the MPL is a complex task that cannot be mastered by a single group. Therefore, four groups from PSI, EPFL and TUM have teamed up to combine their complementary knowhow in synthesis, materials preparation, advanced ex and in situ microscopic characterization for structure and composition analysis, operando X-ray imaging for water management, and cell testing.The primary research questions of i) reduction of Pt-loading for the conventional, ii) operability at low and freezing temperature of the thin pure metal, iii) stability of non-noble-metal catalysts layers, respectively, as well as performance and durability of the novel MPL structure and composition will be tackled in 5 work packages including 8 PhD theses and a close collaboration and exchange between the four partners based on regular workshops and focus sessions.The major outcome of the project, i.e., design rules for the 4 porous layers based on the fundamental characterization, will have significant impact to the PEMFC community, both in academia and industry. Industry will be able to license the knowhow either by scaling-up the porous structures designed in the project or by implementing the design rules in their proprietary processes. Either way, the outcome of the project will push the development of PEMFC technology to the goals required for large-scale commercial application and positive impact on the energy system.; Electron Microscopy; X-Ray Tomographic Microscopy; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell; Porous structures; Mass transport; Electrocatalysts; Small Angle X-Ray Scattering; Membrane Electrode Assembly",4,1,Collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,NA,20500,20300,NA,NA,20400

The Earth receives 7000 times more energy from the sun than is consumed each year and photovoltaic solar cells are on the rise. The matured silicon solar cells technology is used for stationary applications; and materials such as CdTe, Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS), and emerging lead halide perovskites (hereinafter perovskites) are used for thin-film and flexible solar cells with light conversion efficiencies below 25 %. Niche markets, such as aerospace applications and vehicle integration, require flexible solar cells with higher efficiencies at a low cost. Highly promising technologies include two-terminal tandem solar cells made out of a small bandgap bottom solar cell such as CIGS absorbing low energy photons, and a top solar cell with a large bandgap perovskite absorbing high energy photons. CIGS/perovskite tandem solar cell efficiencies are inferior to single-junction perovskite solar cells and far behind their theoretical efficiency of 45 %. The fabrication process of the bottom CIGS cell re-mains unchanged compared to the single-junction solar cell fabrication, however, alternative fabrication methods have to be used for the perovskite solar cell due to thermal- and solvent incompatibilities of the underlying layers. Another obstacle is the surface roughness of CIGS solar cells, spin-coating of perovskite layers on top can result in pinhole formation and electrical shortcuts defecting the perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, for ob-taining high solar cell efficiencies, the electric currents of the individual solar cells have to be matched which remains a major challenge, as the subcells cannot be investigated individually due to a lack of access to the intermediate electrode. We hypothesize that adhesive wafer bonding circumvents the shortcomings in fabrication and current matching condition analysis. Wafer bonding is an industrial process where two individually processed substrates are 'glued' together. Therefore, each solar cell can be processed individually under optimized conditions and afterward brought together with a conductive adhesive. Intentional misalignment of the subcells gives access to the intermediate layer and the current matching conditions can easily be determined. Importantly, this permits the evaluation of each subcell during tandem operation, which to date has been limited in traditional device architectures. This holistic view of the tandem cell provides the opportunity to identify and eliminate the inefficiencies, which have prevented tandem solar cells from surpassing single-junction perovskite solar cells. We will increase the perovskite bandgap, reduce the open-circuit voltage deficiency and test the adhe-sive wafer bonding concept. With the easy access to the intermediate electrode, we will investigate the interface between the two subcells achieving current matching conditions, optimizing the charge carrier selectivity and the band alignment. Ultimately, the research project will lead to flexible, low-cost, thin-film tandem solar cells with light conversion efficiencies above 35 % with potential applications in electric- and hybrid airplanes. The developed technology may also be transferred to the Si/perovskite tandem solar cells increasing their light con-version efficiency and reducing the electric energy price. ; perovskite; band alignment; solar cell; recombination layer; interface; CIGS; current matching; tandem",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Switzerland, the parliament has recently (25.09.2020) adopted a complete revision of the CO2 law, setting the objectives and measures of the Swiss climate policy until 2030. The challenge crosses sectors and domains, and for this reason, solutions can only be found through collective innovation efforts spanning a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary sciences. New paradigms are being introduced. The concept of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) is one such paradigm. The principle of PEDs is to create an area within a city’s boundaries capable of generating more energy than consumed and agile/flexible enough to respond to the dynamics of the energy market. Thus, PEDs offer a framework to promote higher energy efficiency, higher renewable energy generation, and higher flexibility in energy management at the local level. The rationale for tackling problems at the neighbourhood scale is that it enables coordination of energy use between buildings, while allowing more flexibility than e.g. the city scale. PEDs aim to have a positive impact on the regional energy system beyond energy balance, for example by providing flexibility or increasing system resilience. The concept of PEDs integrates a wide range of physical scales of objects, from domestic appliances to regional energy networks, as well as a broad range of human activities such as behaviour, laws, taxation etc. Its study therefore integrates a wide spectrum of sciences (e.g., technology, society, business and policy). In a recent synthesis of 61 European PED and towards-PED cases, Bossi et al. (2020) note that the lack of appropriate business models and funding schemes is the most frequent challenge in the implementation of projects; conversely the existence of such schemes is one of the most frequently cited success factors. While in Europe, the Commission and member countries have massively invested in this concept through research and financial support programs, no projects under the PED concept have been identified in Switzerland.?Taking as reference (a) existing Swiss energy programs (e.g. 2000W Society), (b) current theory on socio-technical systems and transitions management, (c) societal energy aspirations and (d) availability of innovative technologies, this project’s main research question are?: are PEDs a suitable instrument to govern the Swiss energy transition? What learnings for governance, citizens involvement, socio-technical implementation and technology deployment are becoming decisive? What would be critical next actions (further research and guidelines) in order to upscale PED in Switzerland? To answer these questions, a participative and interdisciplinary approach is proposed including four perspectives (society, policy, business and technological) to address typology and scalability of existing cases under the full range of conditions in European countries. With this approach, the main objectives addressed are:? Objective 1: Identification and analysis of existing PEDs concepts and challenges. This addresses the research question: Whether or how existing concepts (including CH PED related concepts) successfully address and coordinate the needs of involved actors in CH and EU?  Objective 2: Potential impact of PEDs on the Swiss energy transition context. This addresses the research question: What is the expected impact of the deployment of PEDs in the Swiss energy transition context (business model, society and technology), including interaction with Swiss related concepts (e.g., 2000W society, Minergie, prosumer and self-consumption communities)?

The fields of artificial photosynthesis for solar fuels and photovoltaics for solar electricity have developed at large in parallel and independently. The former is lagging behind as far as technology is concerned, but keeps greater promise because it can theoretically satisfy the world’s need for fuels, which amounts to 80% of the current world energy consumption [Thapper 2013]. Employing biological components for solar energy conversion has been studied for a long time [Rabinowitch 1961]. Empa’s Artur Braun started working on inorganic photoelectrochemical cells for solar hydrogen production in 2008 (see publication list). Since 2010 Braun and group members functionalized semiconductor photoelectrodes with light harvesting proteins from cyanobacteria and found, for example, increased photocurrent and hydrogen evolution [Bora 2012, Ihssen 2014, Faccio 2015, and Schrantz 2017]. They also investigated the properties of algal biofilms on photoelectrodes [Braun 2015]. Implementation of the biological photosynthesis apparatus in solar energy conversion technology is now again of interest. This is because biological components can in principal be grown at low cost and because they can rejuvenate eternally by biological reproduction. Currently there is great interest in making bio-hybrid electro-chemical devices and understanding the physical and chemical interactions between the animate and inanimate matter components at the molecular scale [Sakimoto 2016]. Semiconductor electrodes will be instrumental for the future artificial photosynthesis apparatus because it provides the electric and ionic nexus between the biological components and readily existing electrical engineering infrastructure in the built environment. Metal oxides, such as those on which Braun and his group members are working on, are for this purpose and technology of particular interest [Bora 2013].Professor WonHyoung Ryu at Yonsei University has developed expertise in the design and single cell analysis of ordered bio-electrode arrays [Bai 2011, Kim 2016]. Braun will visit Ryu for a joint project using this technology. Braun will complement with his expertise on charge carrier dynamics and electronic structure of electrochemical systems of metal oxide semiconductors.

In particular, this proposal aims to improve bioelectricity production from these bacteria by improving the electron transfer between the microbe and the electrode surface. This electronic interaction between the bacteria and the electrode surface is the bottleneck in existing microbial technologies. We aim to overcome this bottleneck by engineering microbes capable of producing conductive polymers that allow them to form an efficient electronic network on the electrode.  The polymer biosynthesis is designed to enhance the microbe's adhesion to the electrode as well as improve charge extraction. This proposal applies this approach to two model bacteria, phototrophic cyanobacteria (CB) and purple non-sulphur bacteria (PNS), to demonstrate the versatility of the approach to different types of microbes. The self-production of conductive layers onto the surface of individual microbial cells enables the development of biologically synthesized electrodes that are adaptive to microbial growth and conducive to promoting cell adhesion. As this latter advantage is critically important for bacteria that suffer from poor biofilm formation, this approach would also open the doors to incorporating new strains that may otherwise fail to sufficiently adhere to the electrode surface. In addition, these engineered bacteria will also be incorporated in a biophotovoltaic system to treat wastewater through active light-harvesting mechanisms.; Naturally occurring monomers; Biophotovoltaics; Living materials; Cyanobacteria; Electrogenic activity; Microbial fuel cell; Proteobacteria; Biopolymers; Bioelectricity",3,1,Collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,NA,20500,20300,NA,NA,30100

Curiously enough, there is currently no consensus of the scientific community to define the nature of SA and the manner it should be applied. However, despite this lack of consensus, a large number of scholars require further inclusion of stakeholder and recognition of importance of context in the process of assessing sustainability. Hydropower is still increasing worldwide, both in terms of installed capacity and energy produced. One specific type of this technology is called storage hydropower plant (SHPP), and is able to provide a large range of services. Some power services support the development of other renewable but intermittent power technologies. As such, SHPP is expected to continue to play a major role in the energy system in the coming decades. However, SHPP systems also involve a series of impacts ensuing from social, environmental and economic aspects. To be able to assess all those impacts from a sustainability perspective requires an integrated approach. Such approaches regarding hydropower assessment are largely overlooked in the scientific literature, with most of the studies focusing on one or two dimensions of sustainability. Institutions such as the UN or IHA have developed some frameworks and guidelines to assess the sustainability of energy and hydropower systems. However, such framework have shown substantial limits to be applied at the project level.A few studies have focused on SA, stakeholder integration and energy systems. They provide innovative stakeholder integrative approaches and methods. For instance, confrontation of theoretical frame with experts interviews or Delphi methods, results analysis with causal mapping and stakeholder value assessment with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) have proved relevant in the assessment of complex and miscellaneous impacts resulting from energy systems. Moreover, they can be applied at the project scale.The research firstly aims to define relevant criteria for SA of SHPP projects in Iceland, in order to test the existing scientific knowledge in the specific area of hydropower. It will be based on the identification and interviews of relevant stakeholders. In the same process, a second central objective is to evaluate the existing interconnection between every identified criteria. Based on a system perspective, this is expected to support a global and holistic perspective on SHPP impacts. Identification of mitigation, compensation impacts and inherent causal relationships is expected to be facilitated. The third objective is to evaluate the relative importance of each criteria for the relevant people. Still in development, the method will largely be based on AHP and Delphi methods. The research is expected to take seven months to be realized. The reason to choose Iceland is motivated by its very specific characteristic, as to know an isolated system and largely hydro-dependent country with existing potential for further development. Moreover, the Reykjavik University benefits from an internationally recognized competence centre in sustainable energy, which will provide me with required and valuable support.Overall, the research is expected to provide innovative insights regarding the specific assessment of hydropower projects from a sustainability perspective. As they should be specifically developed for other application, such methods are increasingly required in the current international context. This project should therefore contribute to its scale to a largely understudied field of research.  ; Sustainability assessment; Perception; Iceland; Stakeholders; Hydropower; Hydroelectricity; Semi-structured interviews; Delphi; Impacts; Holistic approach",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20700,10600,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some of the most powerful realizations of controlling molecular systems are found in nature through tailoring noncovalent interactions. This project relies on the underlying concepts of supramolecular chemistry to develop functional materials for energy conversion, with particular focus on the leading thin-film photovoltaic technologies based on hybrid perovskites, which feature extraordinary performances in solar-to-electric power conversion. However, their intrinsic instabilities hamper practical applications, which is the result of the reactivity to oxygen and water, as well as the detrimental ion migrations in response to voltage and light. It has been shown that some of these degradation processes can be suppressed in layered low-dimensional perovskite analogs incorporating organic materials, which have so far been primarily electronically insulating, thereby resulting in stability enhancements at the expense of their performances. This project aims to overcome this setback via three research areas. (1) It will involve introducing electroactive molecular systems into hybrid perovskites that are molecularly engineered to assemble based on various noncovalent interactions, forming impermeable layered supramolecular frameworks resistant to environmental factors and ion migration while contributing to charge extraction. (2) Furthermore, this research will employ moieties that are stimuli-responsive, purposefully changing their structure upon irradiation and bias, thus (3) uniquely controlling the properties of hybrid materials under operation conditions. This approach will thus address the challenges associated with the stability of hybrid perovskites without compromising their performances while extending their utility beyond photovoltaics by providing a proof of concept towards adaptive stimuli-responsive nanotechnologies. The objectives will be accomplished by means of a multidisciplinary approach based on function-driven molecular design, followed by synthesis and characterization, as well as fabrication and evaluation of the corresponding thin-films and optoelectronic devices. To this end, a combination of spectro-electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques will be employed. As a result, this study is expected to demonstrate the utility of supramolecular engineering in advancing photovoltaics, while realizing unprecedented hybrid materials based on stimuli-responsive molecular moieties that will pave the way for smart nanotechnologies in the future.; supramolecular engineering; stimuli-responsive molecular materials; layered hybrid perovskites; smart materials; energy conversion; photovoltaics",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

Artificial photosynthesis mimics the natural photosynthesis by transforming sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into value-added chemicals (such as fuels for transportation like hydrogen or hydrocarbons). Water oxidation plays a key role in this process. In fact, it is the only scalable anodic reaction to pair with the cathodic fuel-forming reactions (H2O reduction to hydrogen fuel and CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons fuels). Yet, light absorbers that can efficiently convert photons into charge carriers that drive this oxidative chemistry, while being stable in the harsh environment required to carry the water oxidation reaction, are still lacking. Many of the promising candidates suggested by theoretical calculations and some experimental results consist of multi-cation oxides. Achieving fine control over the composition and morphology (i.e. controlled nanostructure and porosity) of such materials is a non-trivial challenge that chemists and material scientists are facing in many different application areas, from batteries to fuel cells and resistive switching memories. This project will contribute to advance the field by devising robust synthetic approaches to complex oxide materials and thus will aid to establishing meaningful structure/properties relationships and to validating theoretical predictions. Specifically, colloidal chemistry will be employed, being one of the most powerful wet-chemistry approaches to control size, shape, composition of nanomaterials and their assembly in three-dimensional architectures. The fine tuning of composition and structural parameters at multiple lengthscales, afforded by this synthetic approach, will provide us with a competitive edge as structure/function correlations that are a necessary means to design new materials or chemically tune existing materials for the optimization of the photoelectrochemical performance.

During this mass movement where birds cover distances of thousands of kilometres, mortality increases due to collisions with wind turbines. Current technologies like radar data and GPS-tracking devices can increase our understanding about individual behaviour and the parameters responsible for the spatial and temporal occurrence of birds in the aerosphere. This knowledge has to be incorporated into a forecast model for the broad front movement over large spatial scales in order to develop a risk assessment strategy for bird collisions with renewable energy power plants. One main task in the proposed work is to provide high-resolution Europe-wide simulations of the flow patterns of bird migration to first of all improve our understanding of spatial density distributions of birds during migration season and secondly to identify areas of high collision risk with renewable energy power plants. Over the last two years and in a cooperative project between the Laboratory for Energy Conversion, ETH Zurich and the Swiss Ornithological Institute, an agent-based bird migration simulation tool has been developed, validated and applied over the area of Switzerland. A mesoscale weather simulation model is used to provide accurate, high-resolution predictions of the spatially and temporally variable wind field. Wind flow has a major influence on the birds’ patterns of migration, as birds use the aerosphere to travel between breeding and overwintering areas. Wind strongly affects the temporal and spatial intensities of birds that are of high importance to predict collision risk with renewable power plants. Until now, the limited availability of radar data that provide information about the number and flight heights of migratory birds and that define the initial conditions of the simulation, limited the spatial extent of the simulation. Recently a Europe-wide network of radar data has become available. This newly available data allows application of the agent-based bird migration simulation tool to extend to larger areas, as well as requires that new models of bird behaviour be developed.As a next step, the PhD student shall perform Europe-wide bird migration simulations, as bird migration is a phenomenon that is influenced by weather dynamics from breeding grounds to overwintering areas. The PhD Student shall predict large-scale mass flow movement patterns to improve our general understanding of a bird’s movement behaviour and bird migration density patterns. The proposed study will also shed light on the wind flow that prevails during migration season and will point out environmental constraints birds have to cope with. The PhD Student shall identify the areas of high collision risk with renewable energy power plants, and provide recommendations regarding the operation and development of renewable energy power plants. Since 2009, the Laboratory for Energy Conversion, ETH Zurich has been developing EnerPol, a system-wide scenario-based assessment simulation tool for energy, transportation and urban infrastructures, and population dynamics. The proposed project shall benefit from this longstanding experience, as well as be able to assure the relevance of the outcomes from the proposed project.

The health sector has shown continuously high growth rates over the recent years and is expected  to further increase its environmental impact. The new inpatient financing scheme, which is based on diagnosis-related groups, and the free choice of health service providers have triggered competition amongst Swiss hospitals. Curbing costs and increasing economic profitability by means of efficient processes and resource savings is of high interest for hospitals and health service providers. Also, a commendable environmental management is a potential competitive advantage. Some Swiss hospitals have already adopted resource management initiatives and have their environmental management certified, showing the increasing interest in this topic. Nevertheless, there is still a large resource reduction potential in the health sector, which is not yet exploited. In this study, we set out to provide a comprehensive overview of environmentally relevant processes in Swiss hospitals.  Specifically, this project aims to (1) develop consistent and comprehensive knowledge concerning resource consumption end efficiency in the Swiss hospitals sector, (2) analyse determinants of life cycle environmental impacts in the health sector and of hospital resource efficiency, (3) work out a list of environmental best practices and investigate the currently realizable options, and (4) test hands-on applications for environmentally optimized processes.Environmentally-extended input-output analysis shows that within the Swiss health-care sector, the main inputs are from the food provision (17%), installation of infrastructure (7%) and energy and water consumption (6%). Medical and optical instruments (8%) and disposal (4%) are also among the inputs with the highest impact. In order to quantify the environmental impacts of hospital activity, we thus include building and equipment, waste management, food and non-food supplies, energy and water use, reprocessing and reuse of equipment as well as general procurement. The structural infrastructure is an interesting area, since hospitals are expected to invest heavily in their infrastructure over the next decades. Consequently, the sector faces the unique opportunity to increase efficiency and decrease the environmental impact on the basis of concrete projects.Our interdisciplinary project team consists of three main partners with complementing competences: The academic lead will be held by the ZHAW Institute for Natural Resource Sciences, who will coordinate the project and implement the environmental life cycle assessment methodology in the hospital context. IWSB will provide health economic input over the complete course of the project and are the administrative leaders of the project. The Fraunhofer-Institute for Material Flow and Logistics (IML), department Health Care Logistics, provide their expertise in optimizing hospital processes. Finally, selected inpatient providers ('partner hospitals') such as from the Insel Hospital Group and Geneva University Hospitals will provide process information in the initiation phase and implement best practices in the implementation phase.The proposed research will provide a cutting-edge overview of the total environmental impact of Swiss hospitals, thus closing the knowledge gap of the environmental impacts and resource efficiency in the health sector. Due to our hands-on applications, we expect our findings to sustainably improve resource efficiency and the environmental awareness in the hospital sector, in Switzerland and abroad.

Similarly, hydropower forms a significant part of the energy transition strategy of many countries. At the global level, hydropower contributes to about 16 percent of the electricity supplies and an estimate of 80 percent of the hydropower potential remaining untapped. (International Energy Agency, 2010).  Many of these world’s hydropower potential and proposed developments are located in river that cross sovereign borders, where the existing regulatory framework is weak and can cause irreversible consequences, such as the case in the Gorges Dam, the Hoover Dam and the Aswan Sam (Dunar & Mcbride, 1993; Fearnside, 1998; Qiu, 2011; Misser, 2013).  There are also enormous number of actors involved in transboundary hydropower project, including development and investment banks, foreign government (investors), multilateral energy construction companies, law firms, inter-government and non-government organisation, individual or group (indigenous or local communities), basin or river authorities, individual state party (representatives) and sometimes the subnational state party, individual government sectors, etc. These actors usually have varying and perhaps even competing interest and power, but most importantly and for purpose of this project, they also have varying regulating legal regimes.  These legal regimes include international water law, International human rights law, international (economic) investment law and laws of international organisations. There is need to understand these legal regimes, to be able to sustainably develop and effectively manage transboundary hydropower project, as well as peacefully resolve their disputes. As has been highlighted in the above analysis, transboundary hydropower project raises many complicated issues and involves various legal regimes. A good understanding of these regimes is essential for effective development and management transboundary project, as well as resolution of their evolving disputes.  Better still, a good understanding of the interaction between the regimes will make for sustainable development and effective management of transboundary hydropower project, as well as peaceful settlement of their disputes. This research project seeks to systematize the legal rules in transboundary hydropower development, management, as well as their dispute resolution. As a research output, the research project will provide a comprehensive list of legal principles or rules from the relevant regimes for the development and management of transboundary hydropower projects. To achieve these broad objects, the study will utilize an integrated legal research methodology.  Integrated legal research approach is essential where a particular legal research object traverse more than one legal regime, such as the transboundary hydropower projects. The approach consists of the identification of applicable legal rules in the relevant regimes and comparative analysis of these rules. The comparative analysis will highlight the similarities and linkages within the various applicable rules. For the purposes of the comparative analysis, the research methodology will also involve the development of analytical frameworks. The analytical frameworks will be streamlined to the relevant issues of transboundary hydropower development and management and their dispute settlement, in order to make for a credible analysis.  The study is essentially a legal research project and will reflect doctrinal legal approach - such as, the decision of the courts, treaty practices, rules of customary international law - especially in the analysis of the various legal rules and principles. The relevance of the research project in contribution to scholarship and the society is vast and its impact is very substantial. The research will go a long way in bridging the literature gap, systemize the applicable rules and offer a new perspective to the study and analysis of transboundary hydropower management. The study will permit an advanced new insight that will enhance the comprehension of the concepts and mechanisms developed in the existing literature so far. The methodological approaches employed in the research will lead to a better appreciation of the sustainable management of transboundary hydropower projects. The need for an integrated legal research is particularly key in development and management of transboundary hydropower project.

We have recently shown that the strong retinogeniculate synapse relaying information from the retina to the thalamus resolves these competing constraints by maximizing energetic efficiency when transferring information. In their physiological state, these synapses are not set to transmit the maximum amount of information possible: information transmission increases when larger excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are injected into the postsynaptic thalamic neuron. However, EPSCs that are larger or smaller than physiological EPSCs decrease the information transmitted per energy used. The physiological EPSC size therefore maximizes energy efficiency rather than pure information transfer across the synapse. In other words, the retinogeniculate synapse trades information for energy savings.This finding echoes our earlier finding that, for information being transmitted at a synapse in the presence of noise, a low presynaptic release probability is the optimal solution to maximize the information transmitted per energy expended on the transmission, providing an exciting explanation for the previously not understood fact that synapses are extremely unreliable, often only releasing neurotransmitter a quarter of the times that an action potential is fired.Together, these findings suggest maximization of information transmission per energy used as a design principle in the brain. However, it is unclear how broadly this principle applies. Whether energy efficiency at excitatory synapses is a special property of strong relay synapses, or a more general principle, also governing synaptic inputs that contribute more weakly to determining the output of the postsynaptic cell is an open question. These findings also raise the question of what mechanisms are in effect in order to achieve energetic efficiency of information transfer at synapses.This project will address these questions using information theory and simulations of biologically validated neuron models. In particular, we will investigate under which conditions energetic efficiency of information transfer arises at weak synapses, what biophysical properties of neurons give rise to energetic efficiency of information transfer and how it can be modulated by local network activity. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that energetic efficiency of information transfer is an emergent property of Hebbian learning, more specifically of spike-timing dependent plasticity. In addressing these questions, this project will open a novel avenue to study neural coding by clarifying the natural physical energetic constraints the brain has to do with. This approach eventually holds the potential to identify some of the mechanisms which link energy consumption at synapses to pathologies. Additionally, this approach might open new avenues in the design of artificial computing systems where energy reduction techniques are now being introduced.; energetic optimality; multicompartment neuron models; synaptic energy consumption; information theory; brain energy",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,30300,30100,NA,NA,NA,NA

The field of polymer science is so important to us that in the last six decades, seven noble prices have been won for research within this field. In recent times, polymer waste management issues and the dwindling reserves of fossil fuel, the main source of polymer feedstock, have caused concerns to be raised about the future. Current approaches to confront these concerns involve looking to plant sources for renewable alternatives and the design of polymers with hydrolysable chains to impart biodegradability function to them. However, most renewable sources of monomers are food crops and thus relying on them for our polymer needs will have a negative effect on world food supply. Also, many of the processes utilized to obtain the monomers and to introduce biodegradability into polymeric materials are neither clean, green nor sustainable. With time, the hands of governments around the world will be forced to make regulations enforcing safer working conditions, cleaner production processes and products with better end of life options.This project aims to address these problems by making bio-renewable and biodegradable polymers utilizing monomers made from the oil extracted from the seeds of the Iron weed plant, Vernonia galamensis sp, a non-food crop which grows in arid areas and so does not take the space needed for growing food crops. The project will employ processes that are cleaner than the state of the art; supercritical carbon dioxide, a green solvent will be utilized and enzymes will be used instead of toxic metal catalyst for polymer synthesis.

It is not only a critical ingredient in current agricultural, pharmaceutical, and light industries, but also an ideal fuel due to properties such as high power density, carbon-neutral, and easy storage and transportation. The current NH3 production largely relies on the traditional Haber-Bosch process (up to 90 % of global production), which is performed at high temperature (673 - 873 K) and pressure (20 - 40 MPa). Such harsh synthetic conditions require intensive energy input, resulting in 1 - 3 % global energy consumption annually. Thus, more efficient and advanced synthetic method is desired.Electrochemical reduction reaction of N2 to NH3 (ENRR) that operates at ambient conditions is emerging as a promising alternative to Haber-Bosch process due to its potential to reduce the capital costs. In recent years, increasing efforts have been made, mostly in developing new catalyst materials toward ENRR. However, most of the previous reports have to face reliability challenges, mostly in accurately determining the amount of produced ammonia due to its low yield. The difficulties lie in the facts that (1) N2 is kinetically stable, hence the electrolysis requires a large overpotential; and (2) N2 has very low diffusivity and solubility in water, but most of the electrolysis was performed in a H-cell with aqueous electrolyte, leading to low current density. While N2’s high kinetic barrier issue cannot be changed or circumvented, its low diffusivity and solubility issue can be avoided by changing the way of electrolysis.Here I propose to improve the low NH3 yield and solve the unreliability problems in current ENRR studies by conducting electrolysis in gas diffusion-based devices (e.g., flow cell, MEA, etc.). In these cells, the N2 diffusion coefficient is 4 order of magnitudes higher than in water, and the concentration of gaseous N2 is 60 times of its solute form, both factors can contribute to a significant increase in ENRR rate. My research works will cover both catalysts development and electrolyzer optimization. I will rationally design new electrocatalysts, studying their structure-reactivity relationship with state-of-the-art characterizations. The prepared catalysts will then be applied to a gas diffusion-based electrolyzer. By engineering the electrolyzer structure and electrode-electrolyte-gas interface, a great number of triple-phase boundary sites are expected.

One of the most basic signal processing tasks to be accomplished by these devices is to detect epileptic seizures. However, current methods for seizure detection are impaired by two main limitations, namely the typically small set of iEEG seizure examples available for training with in addition significant variability among patients, and the very restricted energy and space of implantable devices. To meet these challenges we here set out to combine methods from brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and memory-augmented neural networks (MANN) to design a framework we refer to as EEGMANN. The two specific main goals of EEGMANN are: 1. To develop a hybrid learning method that can quickly generalize from very few iEEG seizure examples. To this end, we will exploit episodic training to first construct a patient-independent feature extractor using our extensive offline iEEG dataset recorded from a large number of patients. This global feature extractor will then be personalized by connecting to an explicit memory that is quickly trained online by few iEEG seizure examples from an individual patient. Thus, this hybrid methodology effectively makes use of the information contained in inter- and intraindividual iEEG seizure recordings, and as a practical result we plan its deployment in the epilepsy monitoring unit. 2. To then significantly improve the energy efficiency of EEGMANN to meet the requirements for the next generation of implantable iEEG monitoring devices. We will utilize cutting edge non-volatile computational memories designed for extreme energy efficiency. Adapting MANN to conform with HDC characteristics will facilitate this objective. HDC manipulates and compares large patterns within memory, which is a highly parallel and extraordinarily noise-tolerant approach due to its holographic representations, i.e. the crucial property that information is evenly spread across the whole extent of the patterns. The parallelism and noise tolerance makes HDC an excellent candidate for nanoscale fabrics such as the IBM computational phase-change memory. As the main result of EEGMANN we expect to develop a novel seizure detection method that makes use of the IBM computational phase-change memory. The impact on the field of epileptology will be that implementation of EEGMANN on this analog computational memory fabric will promote a new generation of extremely energy-efficient and thus smaller implantable iEEG processing devices, which will contribute to the dawning revolution of highly personalized out-of-hospital treatments of patients suffering from pharmacoresistent epilepsies. The broader impact of EEGMANN will be its potential applications in diagnostics and therapies of other neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and for different types of brain--machine interfaces.; Epilepsy; EEG; Energy Efficient Hardware; Hyperdimensional Computing; Phase-Change Memory; Neurology; Digital Biomarker",2,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,30700,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

Especially important are technological advanced and sustainable materials for applications including, but not limited to, energy storage (neuromorphic computing) and energy conversion (water splitting). In all these cases, the compositional, microstructural, and chemical understanding of the behavior of surfaces and interfaces when exposed to appropriate stimuli has the potential to enhance our know-how of the processes that take place during device operation. It is imperative, therefore, to develop characterization methods that are able to probe the physicochemical materials properties on the very local scale, or even to manipulate these properties at the atomic level in a fully controlled manner. Towards this goal, the advancements of electron microscopy nowadays enable scientists to look into the atomic structure of nanomaterials with unprecedented spatial resolution. However, a qualitative evaluation of the properties at the nanoscale can no longer facilitate the further advancement needed for transferring these materials from the research environment to an enhanced, commercially available product. The reliability and reproducibility of such devices is critical and quantitative evaluation of atomic scale reactions becomes a requirement. Herein, we aim to continue addressing fundamental questions governing the functionality of nanostructures by applying and developing in-situ nanoanalytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The approach is two-fold and it is centered in linking the exceptional properties of ABO3-type perovskites to site specific reaction mechanisms that can directly be extrapolated to the bulk-like behavior of the corresponding devices. The first objective is to address issues with the miniaturization of polar, ferroelectric lead-based and lead-free perovskites, which are on the forefront of the microelectronic industry for neuromorphic computing and memory-based devices. These devices are based on structures that their usability is inhibited by the slow relaxation processes which occur under voltage pulses. To quantitative evaluate the polar system in its entity, a systematic study of the effect of electrical poling of single crystal ferroelectrics in varying temperatures as a function of electric bias will be undertaken. Advanced TEM methodologies will be applied in situ including techniques for mapping in detail the crystal phases of complex perovskites and techniques for quantitatively evaluating the local polarization and strain as a function of temperature and applied potential. Perovskite oxides are also considered as the best contenders in replacing the conventional, costly, metal catalysts due to their exceptional catalytic performance. Their applicability, however, is hindered due to the little knowledge of the actual mechanisms by which the reactions proceed. To address this, electrical measurements of catalysts in liquids will be performed in-situ in a micro-volume of the solution in a TEM. The aim is to resolve the effect of catalyst wettability and surface functionality as a function of temperature and applied potential, while undertaking a robust methodology in order to clarify the mechanisms of doping and product production of oxygen evolving catalysts.The topics and methodologies proposed within this project have the potential to improve the functionality of existing perovskites and also create new opportunities for prototyping innovative, next generation materials.; electron microscopy; in situ techniques; nanomaterials; ferroelectrics; catalysts; energy storage; energy storage",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

This, so-called blue energy, is induced by the osmotic pressure built between reservoirs at different solute concentrations. It is estimated that the overall power that can be generated by exploiting salinity concentration gradients is of the same order as that currently produced from hydroelectric power plants, globally. So far, however, osmotic energy remains a largely unexplored source, due to challenges in fabricating membranes that can effectively harvest the potential of seas and oceans.Recent progress in nano-fabrication and nano-characterization techniques, as well as the rise of graphene and other two-dimensional materials, have opened new venues for the development of osmotic membranes. For instance, recent experimental works have shown that boron nitride nanotubes and nanometer MoS2 single-layer nanopores can harvest osmotic energy with unprecedented efficiency. However, a number of  fundamental questions have to be addressed in order to scale-up the production of nanomembranes for osmotic power generation. In particular, the atomistic mechanisms of ionic and water transport in real nanomembranes under different transport regimes are unclear. Pioneering experimental results suggest that the chemical nature and the electronic structure of different materials is key to understand osmotic and nanofluidic transport in real systems, but it is extremely challenging for experiments to provide atomic resolution into the structure and transport at the nanomembrane/fluid  interface. Computer simulations instead, play an increasingly important role and it is now possible to use them to bring about major breakthroughs in understanding the fluid structure and dynamics at the interface with nanomembranes under operating aqueous conditions. However, so far there has been little to no attempt to investigate the role of the electronic structure on osmotic flow in nanofluidics. At the nanoscale specific electronic effects play a crucial role, and understanding the relation between the electronic structure and osmotic transport is therefore key to design efficient membranes for osmotic energy conversion. Given the importance to find and effectively harvest different types of renewable energy sources, this represents a fundamental question in the chemical and physical sciences, which has not been answered, yet.We aim to answer this question with atomistic simulations, by coupling systematic studies on model systems treated using empirical potentials with in depth explorations of more realistic membranes, treated using ab initio (i.e. quantum mechanical) methods, to account explicitly for the electronic structure of liquid/solid interfaces. To achieve this goal, the hydrodynamic theory of osmosis will be coupled to enhanced sampling techniques, in order to compute transport properties at nanofluidic interfaces using ab initio simulations. We will apply this framework to the study of ion and water transport across atomically thin membranes, both in the linear regime and in the nonlinear regime, with a particular focus on the recently observed ionic Coulomb blockade. This work will also take advantage of the exchange with experimental groups involved in the fabrication of nanomembranes to explore novel materials for osmotic energy applications. By accounting explicitly for the electronic structure of different materials, not only will we establish the key physical principles for the development of stable and efficient nanomembranes for osmotic power generation, but we may also improve our understanding of water purification and desalination, of ionic transport in biological pores, and of sequencing of DNA through nanopores.; electronic structure; single-layer nanopores; osmotic transport; two dimensional materials; ab initio molecular dynamics; nanofluidics; osmotic energy conversion",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

The efficient reduction of carbon dioxide using water and electricity from renewable sources (i.e. solar, wind, tidal) is the most promising method to store renewable energy in a global scale. Moreover, if the transformation could be done efficiently and selectively at potentials close to the thermodynamic minimum, the reduction of CO2 to chemicals and fuels could contribute to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and stop global warming.However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is one of the most challenging chemical transformations. State-of-the-art catalyst require large overpotentials and produce a large mixture of products that require down-stream processing. In this postdoctoral work I propose an approach to engineer active sites in the interface between two materials: one for the activation of the CO2 molecule and the second material for the reduction of protons at low overpotentials. The ideal active site should transfer hydrogen atoms to the absorbed CO2 molecule in the interface with a small activation energy for the reaction. My approach implements design principles found in the active sites of Formate dehydrogenases, the most active catalysts for CO2 reduction known to man. My approach also draws inspiration from mechanistic studies for the hydrogenation of CO2 on homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts.The architecture of a high surface area electrode is also proposed in order to address issues related to stability, gas diffusion, electron transport and activity.; Carbon dioxide utilization; Material science; Catalysis; Renewable energy; Nanotechnology; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemistry",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the context of this energy transition, energy planning models - often based on optimization - are needed to guide and support decision-makers at urban, industrial and national levels. In the current energy planning practice, most of these models are deterministic: this means that they do not consider uncertainty and rely on long-term forecasts for important parameters. However, over the long time horizons of energy planning (typically 20-50 years), forecasts often prove to be inaccurate and thus frequently lead to wrong investment decisions. Although this shows the need of considering uncertainty in energy planning, uncertainty is to date seldom integrated in energy models. This project focuses on the development of an advanced stochastic framework for energy planning under uncertainty. Concretely, the work will focus on two main research axes: i) the development of a new energy model and ii) the application of advanced stochastic optimization methods to such model, with the ultimate goal of supporting decision-making under uncertainty in the energy field. On the one hand, under the energy modeling aspect, most models available in the literature are proprietary, rather complex and computationally expensive, which limits their use for uncertainty applications. In this context, existing open-source frameworks will be reviewed and the most promising ones will be used as a basis to develop a new model. Thanks to the choice of an appropriate time resolution and to the consideration of all energy storage options, this computationally efficient model will be particularly suitable for studying low-carbon energy systems with very high shares of electrification and (stochastic) renewables. On the other hand, in the recent years novel methods have been proposed in the operational research (OR) literature to allow the consideration of uncertainties in optimization models. Among them, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is particularly promising for energy applications, where little information is available to characterize input uncertainties. However, applications of DRO to energy models are, to date, very limited. A reason for this is that large-scale energy models often present features which make it difficult to develop generalized and tractable robust formulations. In this context, these limiting features will be addressed to enable the application of DRO to the newly developed energy model by means of a real-world case study. The research work will be performed at Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Strbac, Dr. Aunedi and Prof. Shah, who are leading figures in energy modeling community; and of Prof. Wiesemann, who is a global expert in DRO. The research work will be in synergy with a major research program involving all the leading energy experts at the host institution. The outcomes of this project can be highly impactful, as the developed framework can help countries and communities to define resilient and robust energy strategies.

Solar energy promises to be a major player in the power generation aiming to cover up to 20% of the global energy demand by 2050. To meet such expectations, a transition towards an innovative technology that is 1) high efficient, 2) cost-effective through cheap and non-toxic materials and less energy-intensive fabrication processes, and 3) long-term stable (=long product lifetime) is the actual need. A recent solar technology based on three-dimensional (3D) Hybrid Perovskites (HP) semiconductors stole the spotlight demonstrating stunning power conversion efficiency (PCE) >22%. 3D HP solar cells (HPSCs), using methyl-ammonium lead-iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) as pioneer material, have been listed by the World Economic Forum (2016) as one of the top 10 technologies in 2016, and recognized as one of the most exciting field of research of our time in optoelectronics. Based on cheap solution-processing materials and easy methods, they hold the promise to be the near future solution to harness solar energy at extremely low-cost (estimated cost <0.2 CHF/Wp). However, despite the exceptional performances, poor stability mainly due to degradation in contact with air and water and the reliance on toxic components, with the associated health/environment risks, substantially hamper their commercialization. HYPER proposes the realization of a new-generation efficient and stable hybrid perovskites solar technology using low-cost and non-toxic materials. The innovative idea is based on the design of new low-dimensional hybrid perovskites and their integration into active interfaces to obtain efficient and stable solar cells. This will be achieved by:  1) the development of new layered (two-dimensional -2D) perovskites air-stable and based on low-cost and environmentally-friendly elements, aiming to improve the material and device stability and eliminate the issues related to toxicity; 2) the integration, for the first time, of the 2D with the 3D perovskites. Enhanced stability of the 2D is combined with the excellent charge absorption and transport efficiency of the 3D, aiming to realize a stable and efficient 2D/3D interfaces to be integrated into stable and efficient devices; 3) realization of an innovative device architecture. The tunable properties of 2D and 3D perovskite joint together will be exploited to boost the device stability and efficiency beyond the state of the art.The key to the success of this project is the interdisciplinary strategy that combines i) the design of new advanced materials (including non-toxic ones) and their integration into innovative interfaces; ii) a comprehensive analysis on the optoelectronic and photophysical processes behind them by means of advanced spectroscopic techniques; and iii) the development of innovative device concepts with efficiency and stability beyond the current limits.

However, to advance both PEC and heterogeneous PC H2 production methods, the main challenge lies in the development of light-harvesting semiconducting materials that have sufficient stability/robustness, adequate photogenerated charge extraction/H2 production efficiency, and can be processed into photoelectrode thin films (for PEC) or stably dispersed as nano- or micro-particles in an aqueous phase (for PC). In this project we will advance the performance and understanding of a promising class of materials for PEC and PC application: the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our lab has previously developed the solution-based processing of 2D nanoflake TMDs and established their activity for inexpensive and scalable solar H2 production, but limitations with photopotential, photon harvesting, and co-catalysis remain. This proposal addresses these issues systematically in four interconnected work packages: (1) Forming donor-acceptor heterojunctions with defect passivated 2D TMD nanoflakes for increased photopotential, (2) Increasing solar light harvesting using nano-structuring approaches, (3) Optimizing non-platinum co-catalyst attachment and tandem cell device integration, and (4) Demonstrating defect passivated 2D TMD nanoflakes in aqueous PC applications. A host of analytical tools centring on our expertise with PEC examination and materials characterization will be employed to gain deep insights into the optoelectronic properties of solution-processed TMDs-including the criteria necessary for type II heterojunction formation and charge transfer at the basal-plane/co-catalyst interface. Scientifically, this work will contribute to the general understanding of the factors limiting the performance of 2D TMD nanoflakes and validate strategies to overcome them. In particular, we will resolve outstanding scientific questions about the requirements of photogenerated charge transfer at heterojunctions of few-layered TMD nanoflakes, demonstrate increased light harvesting/reduced recombination via blocking layers/nanostructuring, and show that semiconducting 2D TMD nanoflakes can generate sufficient photopotential for PC H2 production.

More than 80% percent of our current global energy consumption comes from the burning of non-renewable fossil fuels which produces enormous quantities of CO2 and contributes to global warming. The key to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and limit the emission of greenhouse gases is the global transition to renewable energy sources. However, the generation of electricity from renewable sources is intermittent and their use in a global scale is conditioned on the development of large-scale energy storage technologies. A promising mechanism to store energy is the use of excess electricity to drive the transformation of CO2 back into synthetic fuels. Among the various products that can be generated from CO2, liquid fuels containing more than 2 carbon atoms (C2+, i.e., ethanol, propanol, butanol) are of great interest as they can be easily stored, transported and transformed back to electricity on demand or combusted in engines. The storage of electricity as fuel necessitates the development of electrocatalysts that are active, stable and most importantly selective. Cu, the best known electrocatalyst for the production of liquid fuels still requires large overpotentials (~1V) and generates a mixture of products that require further separation. Therefore, the development of catalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels at low overpotentials has been recognized as a key technology for the storage of renewable energies and the reduction of carbon emissions.   During the first year of my postdoctorate in the Jaramillo group at Stanford University, I have combined experimental and mathematical methods in the study and development of catalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels as proposed in my Early Postdoc.Mobility (EPM) Fellowship. I have: (1) Developed a mathematical model for mass diffusion during electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R). (2) Discovered synergistic electrocatalytic effects for alcohol formation on Au-Cu bimetallic electrocatalysts. (3) Designed and constructed high surface area electrodes for the production of C2+ alcohols. Although we have made great strides towards the development of more selective electrocatalysts for liquid fuels in this short time, the underlying mechanism for the enhancement in selectivity is poorly understood.The second part of my research stay at Stanford will aim to elucidate the principles that dictate the selectivity to liquid fuels during electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R). Within the next 18 months, I aim to: (1) Perform a systematic study of the competition between CO2R and hydrogen evolution, the competing, undesirable reaction. (2) Develop experimental electrochemical methods to quantify and characterize surface-bound reaction intermediates during CO2R. (3) Build a full kinetic model for electrochemical CO2R in collaboration with the theoretical electrochemistry group here at Stanford. In order to achieve these goals, I will use a gastight rotating disk electrode to systematically change the flow of protons and CO2 or CO towards the surface of the catalyst and study the competition between CO2R and hydrogen evolution. I will also use electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in combination with in situ spectroscopic techniques (i.e. Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) in order to quantify and characterize reaction intermediates. Finally, I aim to extract charge transfer coefficients from electrochemical experiments and use them as experimental basis for the construction of a full kinetic model for CO2R.

In this context, energy storage devices are particularly important as they can play a critical role toward versatile, stable, and efficient utilization of intermittent renewable resources. Among various energy storage technologies, electrochemical energy storage (EES), specifically based on batteries has garnered tremendous interest in recent times by powering portable electronics and enabling vehicle electrification. They also seem a natural fit for small to medium scale storage applications due to their high round trip energy efficiency, long cycle life, pollution free operation, variable power and energy characteristics, and low maintenance costs. However, modern batteries are still limited by serious fundamental and technical challenges and none of them satisfy all of the major performance matrices like cost/kilowatt hour, specific energy (Wh/kg), specific power (kW/kg), safety, and cycle life.  Alkali metal batteries (AMBs) present exciting opportunities to push the energy limits and versatility of battery devices further by replacing graphitic/carbon anode, commonly used in commercial lithium ion batteries, with alkali metal.  Alkali metals are the ultimate negative electrodes due to their high specific capacities and low electrochemical potential. Moreover, alkali metals are the only choice to complement oxygen or sulfur in high energy chemistries like Li-S , and Li-O2 or Na-O2 batteries.  Yet, uncontrolled dendritic growth at the alkali metal electrode during electrochemical stripping/deposition, and their incompatibility with the available liquid organic electrolytes pose crucial challenges in the effort to develop safe and high performance systems.  The organic electrolytes are also prone to oxidation at high voltage and therefor forbid the utilization of high voltage cathodes. Clearly, to tap into the promise high energy safe batteries it is imperative to substitute organic electrolytes with fast ion conducting solid electrolytes possessing superior electrochemical and mechanical stability.  In this context, this proposal seeks to develop high performance single Li+/Na+ conducting polymeric and inorganic solid electrolytes that can enable safe and stable operation of alkali metal anode, and high energy density materials like sulfur, oxygen, and high voltage intercalation materials at the cathode in all solid state batteries (ASSBs). The applicant would focus on designing (a) polymer/polymer-nanocomposite electrolyte based on sulfonated polyether ether ketone with unity Li+/Na+ transference number and high ionic conductivity, (b) solid state Li+ and Na+ conductors based on selenium analogues of Li/Na - Argyrodite of general formula A6PSe5X (A: Na, Li; X: Br, I) to enable the development of higher energy safe and stable AMBs/ASSBs. Furthermore, the polymeric and solid electrolytes may also function as the protective membrane to stabilize Li (or Na) anodes in typical liquid electrolyte cells and increase their energy density by ~3 fold compared to the cell using graphite anodes. Such protective membranes would be also crucial for the stable operation of high capacity Li-S and metal-O2 batteries using organic liquid electrolytes. Moving beyond conventional liquid-electrolyte lithium-ion batteries is a sensible next step that offers sustainability and cost-effectiveness.  This requires an evaluation in the science underpinning potential devices, including the discovery of new materials, their electrochemistry and an increased understanding of ion mobility and interfacial stability.

The interdependencies between the electricity and gas sectors are not limited to physical coupling components such as G2Ps, P2Gs, and the electricity-driven compressors in the gas network [7]. They are, in most cases, operating with different utilities and independent system operators (ISO) [2]. The energy contracts between these two sectors introduce another layer of interdependency, that is, economic coupling [8]. This research will address three main questions, i.e. (i) the systemic vulnerabilities of individual and integrated electricity and natural gas systems considering both physical and economic couplings; (ii) the critical components of IEGS, which could be different from those of individual system owing to the interdependencies; (iii) optimal defense and hardening strategies of IEGS under multiple contingencies. However, there are two major obstacles in deploying the available energy models. First, owing to there specific purposes, many of them ignore the details of component models and operational constraints which are essential in vulnerability analysis like, METIS [9], EUCAD [10] and LIBEMOD [11]. Second, more detailed models are limited to one energy sector and ignore the physical/economic interdependencies e.g. DIgSILENT/PowerFactory [12, 13], Swissmod [14]. To bridge this gap, a unified methodology and simulation tool will be developed using a multilevel optimization approach [15]. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary research plan aims to present a more realistic operation of two systems with bi-directional energy conversion. To accomplish these goals, the following steps are required:1.One-level optimization problem to co-optimize an IEGS operation planning and scheduling: it is mandatory to model different system assets taking into account coupling components and the corresponding energy flow models. Such a model will suffer from non-convex and non-linear equations e.g. Weymouth equation in the gas system and AC power flow in the power system [16]. To guarantee the global optimality of the solution, state-of-the-art linearization and convex relaxation methods [16, 17] will be used to have a mix integer linear programming (MILP) problem. This one-level MILP problem allows the use of high performance, efficient and reliable algorithms as well as off-the-shelf solvers [18]. 2.Bi-level optimization problem to find the systemic vulnerability of the IEGS: A new level will be added on top of the one-level problem that introduces a bi-level co-optimization MILP problem. It is a hierarchical leader-follower problem [19]. The upper level (leader) trying to maximize the damage with a limited interdiction budget (e.g., outage of lines) and the follower (operator) trying to minimize the probable consequences. Thanks to this rational strategy, the critical components whose failures lead to the largest system loss can be determined. The nested column-and-constraint generation (NC&CG) algorithm [20] will be adopted to solve the proposed bi-level MILP problem. 3.Tri-level optimization problem to propose an optimal hardening plan and a defense strategy under threats: A tri-level co-optimization model will be introduced by adding a defender level to the bi-level model. This new level will minimize the probable consequences with a limited budget for the defender’s protection to increase the reliability, robustness, and resilience of the IEGS. The NC&CG algorithm will be adopted to solve the proposed tri-level MILP problem. However, the main aim of the project is to develop a tri-level MILP problem for the IEGS, it will be developed in a modular structure. This means the decision-makers in both sectors can decide to employ it for the scheduling (step 1), vulnerability assessment (step 2) and optimal hardening plan (step 3). They can also use it in there respective sectors ignoring the interdependencies. Cross-fertilization between methodologies and applications can be expected in this work. The performance of the model will be illustrated using the small-scale, medium-scale and real-life IEGS studies [21]. The projected result will have a practical as well as an academic interest.; multi-energy system; IEGS; hardening plan ; power to gas; vulnerability; natural gas system; interdependencies ; power system",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20700,NA,NA,NA,NA

The solution to this problem is to promote higher energy efficiency in buildings by increasing the thermal insulation layer (through several programs in Europe and Switzerland). However, an important shortcoming is that this reduces the usable floor area substantially and this has a substantial cost in big European cities, where the living space is highly limited and particularly expensive (~10k CHF/m2). In this sense, thick and traditional thermal insulation also increase drastically the fire risk when flammable insulation is used [1]. Resolving both issues is crucial for the building sector as a whole. In terms of fire safety, recent updates of the European regulation for energy performance of buildings include new requirements, one step further into the trend of prohibiting the use of flammable insulation (low cost), already existing in high-rise buildings in some European countries. Due to this, the near future of thermal insulation for the mass market (especially in big cities) will be non-flammable ultra-high performance thermal insulation that can match the toughest environmental norms while not compromising living space. The market is however devoid of such products and it is the objective of fill this gap.My solution to the above challenge lies in the development of superinsulating aerogel mortars and building systems that will be manufactured by my startup company and sold through strategic sales partners. This project aims to bring to the market the best existing thermally insulating mortar in terms of thermal conductivity to strength ratio (TC <16 mW/m·K / 0.2 MPa of compressive strength, x2 higher thermal insulation compared to similar products). The output of the project is to consolidate and upscale this technology (achieving market readiness), focusing on the manufacture of non-flammable ultra-high performance thermal insulation for the mass market (boards and sprayed renders).In this sense, the cost analysis shows that the floor space gain overcompensates the higher material cost. Importantly, floor space cost will increase in time, while material costs should decrease. Indeed, the main cost of the material comes from aerogel production that is forecasted to reduce by 70%, as this material continues to find more applications and its production volume increases..; Utra-high performance thermal insulation; Silica aerogel; Mass market",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,10300,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, this process requires high temperature, high pressure, and fossil-derived H2 and thus is capital and energy intensive, resulting in 1-2% of world energy consumption and 1.4% of global CO2 emission. Electrochemical N2-to-NH3 reduction reaction (NRR) has been considered as a promising alternative for artificial nitrogen fixation and it has the potential to be powered by renewable electricity. Currently, the electrochemical alternative is limited by low current density (microampere to milliampere per cm2), high overpotential, and low selectivity (<15%). Inspired by biological nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, the project proposed herein aims to develop a light-driven nitrogen fixation system that combines the strength of nitrogenases (high selectivity and rate of catalysis), hierarchical electrodes (for high enzyme loading to reach a high current density), and semiconductors (for photogenerated electrons) for sustainable NH3 production with input of only N2, water, and sunlight. Specifically, the nitrogenase-electrode systems will be evaluated and optimized by in situ and operando techniques for efficient (>1 mA/cm2) and selective (>50%) electroenzymatic NRR, followed by a series of methods for rigorous product quantification. Ultimately, the optimized system will be integrated with a photovoltaic or a photoelectrochemical tandem cell for bias-free photo-electroenzymatic NH3 production.

Low cell densities in phototrophic microalgae cultivation on CO2 as carbon source lead to low lipid productivities and high costs and energy expenditures for harvesting and downstream processing. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a process concept that tackles these challenges from several points of action and includes the following prospects: (i) The immobilization of microalgal cells in a biofilm to omit harvesting of microalgal biomass from low density suspensions; (ii) The optimization of the light environment of the culture; (iii) The creation of a nitrogen gradient in the biofilm to enable biomass production in the nitrogen rich zone and simultaneous lipid accumulation in the nitrogen depleted zone; (iv) The application of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment directly in the biofilm to permit online extraction of lipids; and (v) The engineering of the microalga to facilitate cellobiose utilization and co-culturing with a cellulolytic fungus to enable the carbon efficient use of low-cost lignocellulosic biomass as additional substrate. We aim to investigate the feasibility of these approaches and at the same time to gain an in depth understanding of the underlying molecular processes in the different biofilm cultivations. To do so, groups with complementary expertise in novel approaches to microalgal cultivation, process engineering and downstream processing will work closely together. Silvia Vignolini, an expert in optics and light delivery in algal biophotoreactors will interact with the project collaborator, Alison Smith, who provides expertise in microalgae molecular biology and biochemistry, to perform fundamental investigations of the molecular processes in the different biofilm cultivations using fluorescent reporter microalgal strains in combination with advanced imaging techniques, complemented by RNAseq analysis. Furthermore, they will engineer Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to be capable of using cellobiose and glucose as carbon source to enable the mixotrophic co-cultivation experiments. Michael Studer, an expert in process engineering of biofilms, will develop simple biofilm reactors to be used by the project partners as well as a fully controlled version that allows amongst others for the targeted creation of a nitrogen gradient by feeding NH3 through a membrane that also serves as biofilm support structure. He will characterize the influence of process specific parameters such as the CO2 mass transfer capacity and the illumination intensity on the cultivation performance in all three trophic modes.

This is due to the fact that manual coding of policy texts is labour-intensive and costly. Our project aims to contribute to overcoming this research gap by creating a training dataset for automated text analysis. To scale up research efforts that investigate policy design systematically and comparatively, this project will make available a database that contains a large number of coded policy texts to be scaled up in order to produce large and comparable datasets of policy design characteristics. Our coding of policy design features is based on the latest conceptual and empirical advances in policy design literature  Ideally, the project’s outcome will spark further research towards automatically extracting relevant information from policy texts in both the fields of computational social science and data science more generally. As many analytical tasks on policy texts require a level of text understanding that is still difficult for current text-processing algorithms, we envision this database to be used for building a tool that helps with manual coding of policy texts, by automatically proposing paragraphs that contain relevant information. To train such an algorithm, a large body of annotated policy texts is needed, in particular one that is annotated at the paragraph level. We will create such a dataset based on actual policy texts. Empirically, we will focus on the policy field of renewable energy, a central element of the bigger societal challenge of climate change mitigation. This project will primarily involve pre-processing existing and publicly available policy text, defining a consistent and transparent coding scheme for policy design features, and annotating the text dataset using this coding scheme. Specifically, the project will consist of the following steps: (1) Defining the language, geographical and topic-related scope of the policies included in the dataset. (2) Obtaining and preparing the relevant policy documents. (3) Defining a coding scheme. (4) Defining a procedure to separate the policy text in small text sections. (5) Annotating the text dataset using the coding scheme. We understand our project to be a first step towards automated assessment of policies’ design features. Far from being an end in itself, such future research tools would enable tackling many of the larger theoretical as well as empirical questions researchers struggle with in relation to policy stability and change. Currently, truly testing such theories is hampered by the lack of comparable data on policy output.

In particular, the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 aims at phasing out of nuclear energy by 2035 and a possible 50-80% reduction in CO2 emission by 2050. Similarly, the UK aims at obtaining 15% of its energy consumption from renewable resources by 2020, as well cut its CO2 emissions in 2050, from the present value, by 80%. These aims can only be reached through a great increase in the production of renewable energy. One way to do so is building large solar farms in rural areas. Another, and complementary, way is to increase the on-site solar-energy production in urban/rural areas, an idea that forms a major part in the concept of decentralized energy supply. The term ‘decentralised energy supply’ means that the energy is produced close to, or at, the site where the energy is used. This is in contrast with centralised energy supply where the energy is normally produced by large power plants and transported through a network or grid to the consumers. The benefits of a decentralised energy system include reduced (i) dependency on fossil fuels, (ii) CO2 emissions, and (iii) energy costs and risks of peaks in energy prices, as well as (iv) greater energy security, partly through better balance between demand and supply. An additional benefit is that decentralised energy is generally from renewable resources, in particular solar energy through photovoltaics (PVs) for electricity production. Decentralising of the urban energy supply, particularly through the use of PVs, requires a comprehensive assessment of their sociotechnical and techno-economic co-evolution. The project therefore aims not only (a) to improve and refine our knowledge of the resource and technical PV potential for Switzerland and the UK, with application to other areas (e.g., Africa), but also (b) to analyse how solar energy technologies and associated social acceptance and affordability evolve together, and (c) how their co-evolution may affect sustainable urban development and energy policies. More specifically, the project aims at exploring (i) the effects of physical urban forms, particularly urban density and the shapes of rooftops, at national scale on the efficiency of energy production through PVs, and to connect urban forms to (ii) different sociotechnical aspects of decentralised electricity production and (iii) and to the associated socio-economic parameters (costs, acceptance, affordability, etc.), as well as (iv) to the energy policies of the local energy production. The results will be analysed within the framework of the projected climate scenarios for 2035 and 2050.In this project a comprehensive assessment and comparison of the physical and sociotechnical aspects of decentralisation PV-produced electricity supply for a sustainable urban development for both Switzerland and the UK at national scale will be explored. When refined, some of the results should be transferable to other areas, with different geographic and cultural frameworks, such as Africa which has a very high irradiation and the potential of producing highly decentralised PV electricity, at a comparatively low cost, in virtually every part of the continent. Currently, the share of people without access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, is on the increase (from 587.1 million in 2008 to estimated 968.3 million in 2030). One aim of the project is thus to transfer the results from the detailed study of the decentralised PV potential in Switzerland and the UK to developing areas such as in Africa, which are highly favourable in terms of solar-energy potential. The main technical methods for analysing the PV electricity potential in this project are as follows: (1) Entropy analysis of regional urban density, (2) GIS spatial analysis for urban energy planning (shapes of buildings and rooftops), (3) statistical methods for analysing socio-economic potential, (technology and electricity costs, including subsides), as well as regulations, policy implementations, and CO2 emissions, (4) machine-learning techniques together with GIS for modelling the potentials of PV electricity production, and (5) clustering methods to identify the sustainable development patterns as regards decentralised electricity production from urban to suburb and to rural areas.; Urban development; Solar energy; Urban sustainability; Urban form; Decentralised electricity production",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,10300,NA,NA,NA,NA

An URFC is a system implementing both an electrolyzer and a fuel cell in a single device. In such a unit, excess energy produced by renewable resources can be stored through hydrogen operating in electrolyzer mode; when electrical energy is required the stored hydrogen can be converted to electrical energy operating the URFC in fuel cell mode. URFCs are attractive for a variety of applications such as energy storage for “on-grid” applications or for remote “off-grid” power delivery, near-zero emission vehicles, hybrid energy storage/propulsion system for satellites, and solar-powered aircraft. Therefore, they can become key energy storage and conversion devices particularly for those countries that have decided to abandon or reduce fossil fuel consumption and nuclear power plants and to move towards renewable energy systems. Low temperature URFC systems can be based on an anion conducting electrolyte or on proton conducting electrolyte. URFCs based on anion exchange membrane provide several advantages over the sister devices based on proton exchange membranes; in fact, the alkaline environment allows using nonprecious metal catalysts at the electrodes and promotes fast kinetic of oxygen reduction and evolution reaction at the oxygen electrode. However, alkaline URFCs still face two major challenges: (i) the development of a conductive and stable anion exchange membranes and (ii) the development of bi-functional electrodes, particularly on the oxygen side where the H2O/O2 redox reactions are significantly irreversible at low temperatures. The goal of the present project is to develop alkaline URFC devices consisting of a conductive and stable anion exchange membrane electrolyte and low cost bi-functional electrocatalysts with high activity towards both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction and good stability. To reach such an ambitious goal the project will be based on a multi-level and multi-disciplinary approach. On the electrolyte side, highly conductive and durable anion exchange membranes will be targeted. Regarding the bi-functional catalysts, we want first to achieve a material property understanding in order to formulate design principles for advanced bi-functional catalysts. The further step foreseen is the development of innovative and operating oxygen electrodes for a complete URFC system. At the end of the present project, when the URFC prototype based on the newly developed bi-functional catalysts and anion conductive membrane will be fabricated and tested, we will be able to compare the efficiencies of our URFC prototype with those of state-of-the-art URFCs, but lowering the device price due to the use of non-noble metal catalysts.; fuel cells, electrolyzer, catalysts, alkaline memb",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,20500,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current biorefinery concepts mainly valorize the carbohydrate fraction of lignocellulose, while the non-utilized lignin is incinerated. The economic viability and the environmental sustainability of such a biorefinery could be improved, if lignin could be valorized e.g. by conversion to aromatic chemicals. This requires amongst others an efficient technology to isolate of a clean and reactive lignin stream. In this project, we are proposing a new method to separate lignin from lignocellulosic biomass by applying high shear forces at a temperature above the glass transition point of lignin. It is known that lignin transforms into a rubbery or viscous state upon heating to the glass transition temperature and thus wood is softening at elevated temperatures leading e.g. to a decrease of energy consumption during disc refining. Furthermore, it has been shown that at elevated temperatures, lignin is coalescing in molten bodies inside the plant cells and can also migrate out of the cells leading to the formation of spherical lignin droplets on the surface of the biomass after cooling. In flow through pretreatments, were molten or solubilized lignin is removed with the liquid phase, no such lignin droplets were observed on the biomass surface and the delignification was significantly higher than in a batch process resulting in a highly reactive remaining solid fraction that could almost quantitatively be hydrolyzed to glucose by cellulolytic enzymes. The aim of the proposed project is to investigate the central research hypothesis that lignin can be separated from the cellulose fraction by applying high shear forces at temperatures above the glass transition zone. To this end, an experimental set-up will be engineered and applied for the treatment of hard- and softwood samples under dry heat conditions as well as under hydrothermal conditions.

Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are rechargeable electrochemical devices where the electroactive species are dissolved in liquid electrolytes which are stored in inexpensive tanks and pumped to a power-converting reactor where they are oxidized and reduced to alternately charge and discharge the battery. As compared to sealed batteries (e.g. lithium-ion), flow batteries offer several advantages including decoupled power and energy scaling, a high ratio of active to inactive materials, simplified manufacturing, and improved safety. Very recently, non-aqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) have attracted significant attention from researchers due to the possibility of operate at higher potentials thanks to the wider electrochemical stability window of the organic electrolytes. While, to date, there has been considerable focus on the discovery of new redox couples, there has been decidedly less focus on how to effectively implement these materials in high-performance nonaqueous flow cells, a critical step in realizing an effective energy storage device. Thus, this project aims to develop of advanced porous electrodes to improve the performance of NAqRFBs.The porous electrodes in RFBs should provide simultaneously several functionalities: distribute the liquid electrolyte effectively, provide active sites for the electrochemical reactions to happen and conduct electrons and heat. It therefore stands to reason that the electrodes need to be optimized in terms of transport, activity, selectivity and durability. NAqRFBs are of scientific and technical interest as a number of promising redox active molecules operate at potentials which approach (or even exceed) the thermodynamic stability window of the electrolyte solution.  This phenomena is typical in lithium-ion batteries where a kinetically-stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms on the electrode surfaces to enable safe operation. To this end, the role of SEI in nonaqueous flow batteries is unknown but is critical to viability. Thus this project aims to elucidate the role of the electrode surface, chemistry and morphology, on its performance with a particular emphasis on understanding the role of SEI, as a surface coating within a porous electrode, and, building on this knowledge, on developing artificial SEI-like surface coatings, via electrografting, which impart a favorable combination of kinetic, transport, and stability properties.; electrografting; energy storage; solid electrolyte interface; redox flow batteries; porous electrodes; non-aqueous redox flow batteries",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA,NA

A sound understanding of the phenomena that underlie trapping of charge carriers in excitons, polarons, and charge transfer states is important for the design and optimization of functional systems of great technological relevance. It has also a fundamental scientific interest in condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, where the mechanisms of exciton dissociation and carrier separation dynamics are not fully established.This research project aims at investigating the detailed mechanism of light-induced charge separation taking place in organic and hybrid photovoltaic absorbers and at junctions with charge-transport materials. Small molecule-based organic-, hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite-, and dye-sensitized solar cells belong to a new generation of solution-processed photovoltaic converters. These make use of ultrafast electron transfer through donor-acceptor heterojunctions and charge carrier extraction at selective contacts. Their working principle is in variance with that of conventional p-n junction photovoltaics as it relies principally on the kinetic competition between charge separation and recombination processes taking place in parallel, rather than on the separation of carriers within space charge layers. Scrutinizing the dynamics of the various individual steps involved in the separation of photogenerated charges, then, requires the use of ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy techniques able to distinguish free carriers from excitonic and polaronic species and trap states. These are indeed believed to play a key role in the charge transport and recombination processes and to control in a large extend the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices.Here we propose to use newly-developed ultrafast techniques to address directly quasi-particles spectroscopy and bound carrier states. Time-resolved ultra-broadband terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS), pump-push-THz probe spectroscopy (PPTPS), and time-resolved electroabsorption spectroscopy (TREAS) techniques were recently developed in our laboratory. These experimental tools are expected to quickly provide results of great significance in combination with more conventional ultrafast techniques, such as pump-probe transient absorption and broadband fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopies.Ultra-broadband time-resolved THz spectroscopy will be applied to small molecule-based organic photovoltaic systems with planar bilayer and bulk heterojunction architectures, as well as to hybrid lead halide perovskite films of various morphologies with the aim of studying exciton delocalization and carrier scattering by grain boundaries, impurities and phonons. A real-time view of hot interfacial charge transfer states formation and relaxation will be provided by using a novel and ambitious approach: A time-resolved two photons optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy setup will be employed for the first time to scrutinize bound carrier dynamics in various systems and conditions and determine directly their binding energy. Time-resolved electroabsorption spectroscopy will be used to investigate electron and hole mobility in cyanine-based bilayer organic photovoltaic devices and perovskite solar cells. The TREAS technique allows to monitor the field induced shift in the photoactive layer absorption spectrum under an externally applied electric field. The subsequent screening of this Stark shift by bound pair splitting and motion of photogenerated charge carriers across the thin film will then be probed optically.

Given the potential of hydrogen fuel, an envisioned dynamic market of LOHCs, and the fact that only 20% of PET ever produced has been recycled, we aim to develop a sustainable liquid organic hydrogen career avoiding the use of fossils. The originality of the idea consists in developing carbon-efficient chemistry for the envisioned catalytic transformations with no CO2 emissions. Being focused on the conversion of waste material into a carrier for a green fuel, this project represents an attractive approach to simultaneously address two global challenges - plastic waste alleviation and renewable fuel implementation.; waste alleviation; renewable; photoreforming; fuel production; fuel carrier; plastic waste; catalysis",1,0,Non-collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,20500,20300,20700,NA,NA,NA

Photocatalysis using semiconducting light absorbers is a promising route to convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in the bonds of the formed molecular products. A good photocatalyst has to efficiently absorb solar light, promote separation of the resulting electron and hole charge carriers and provide high catalytic efficiency for the targeted chemical reaction at its surfaces. While many reactions can be photocatalyzed, photocatalytic water splitting and in particular the oxygen evolution (OER) half-reaction is considered to be a good test case to characterize the activity of different semiconductors. Among earth-abundant semiconductor materials that have suitable band gaps, perovskite oxynitrides have emerged as a highly promising class of visible-light absorbers.The preceding project has, for the first time, established the atomic-scale surface structure of these oxynitride materials using density functional theory calculations and highlighted that they have promising catalytic properties. Moreover, we have shown that they can be rendered ferroelectric under compressive epitaxial strain, which will dramatically improve electron-hole separation and, with the switching of the ferroelectric polarization, may enable unprecedented control of reaction pathways. While these results highlight the potential of oxynitrides for photocatalytic applications, they also lead to additional open questions. As such, we have found that the effect of the ferroelectric polarization on the reactivity may be affected by oxidizing adsorbates under photocatalytic application conditions but the relation between polarization, adsorbate coverage and fundamental material parameters is not yet clear. Also, in our calculations, we observed a photo-corrosion instability resulting in N2 or NO evolution under photocatalytic application conditions, which indicates that oxynitrides need to be protected, for example by cocatalysts or protective catalytic coatings. To address these open questions, the goals of this extension project are to: 1) more deeply investigate the effect of ferroelectricity on the catalytic activity of the surface, focusing on application conditions with oxidizing adsorbates; 2) study which materials are suitable as protective and catalytic coatings for oxynitrides and how their thickness affects the stability of the oxynitride and the catalytic activity of the coating.; Density functional theory; Oxynitrides; Photocatalysis",1,0,Non-collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,20300,NA,20500,NA,NA,NA

A large number of actors (e.g. technicians, engineers, facility managers, call centre operators, care-takers, etc.) contribute to on-going functioning, efficiency, quality and performativity of various energy flows (electricity, gas, heat). In Switzerland, research focuses either on scientific and technological innovation of energy transition (ET) or on the behavioural and regulatory aspects of energy consumption. No research currently addresses the mutations of energy efficient infrastructure through situated practices of use, operation and servicing, which in turn re-specify the infrastructure’s sustainability and durability. Against this background, this project has three objectives:1)To ethnographically record and analyse maintenance and repair work on heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) infrastructure.2)To visually document how repair and maintenance work relates to and shapes buildings and infrastructure.3)To develop a theoretical and methodological framework to understand repair and maintenance as steady agents of ET.Hitherto research shows that the following levels have to be taken in account when analysing repair and maintenance work (Bovet, Strebel and Sormani forthcoming): 1) the worn out or broken thing (material level); 2) the organisational framework (socio-technical level); and 3) the accomplished practices (situational level). Each of the project objectives will be worked out on three analytical levels. And in turn, each level will consist of themes, from which research questions will be derived.ET infrastructure repair and maintenance is a very dynamic and complex field. Because of their invisible nature, repair and maintenance remain a ‘missing link’ (Graham and Thrift 2007) in social theory. The planned project uses theoretical concepts from various fields: Science and Technology Studies will be used to understand how ET infrastructures relate to extended social and geographical time-spaces; Infrastructure Studies will be used to understand the incremental and relational work of repair and maintenance; Energy Research will be used as an entry point to locate where maintenance and repair could contribute to energy transition; Social Practice approaches will be used to understand how workers reconfigure ET technology in their everyday work.The project seeks to provide solid social-scientific knowledge on the unfolding work of repair and maintenance on ET infrastructures. It will develop the approach of broken world thinking (Jackson 2014) through research in two infrastructural settings. The first empirical focus is on energy saving and building technology. The project analyses care work on heat and cooling systems in office and residential buildings. The second empirical focus is on energy transport and storage. The project analyses models, business cases and everyday practices of repair and maintenance work on district heating and heat storage. Research in these two settings will be supplemented with mappings and diagrams that aim at visualising impact and transformation capacity of repair and maintenance on selected buildings and ET infrastructures.Empirical investigation in the two infrastructural settings is grounded in a qualitative, case-based approach. Diagrams and maps will be produced from 20 to 30 year maintenance records of selected buildings and ET infrastructures. The research project aims at generating detailed and original factual evidence of the capacities of repair work, and also at providing the energy and building sectors with a coordinated and rigorous assessment of transformation and adaptation as qualities of energy transition. The project was implemented from 01.10.2017 - 31.12.2021. It was intitated at ETH Wohnforum - ETH CASE, Department of Architecture, ETH Zurich and executed at the Institut de Géographie, Université Lausanne (Main applicants: Ignaz Strebel from project start to 31.07.2019; Jean Ruegg from 1.08.2019 to project end).; repair; interaction; energy transition; district heating; HVAC; maintenance; building technology; infrastructure",1,0,Non-collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,10300,10400,10600,NA,NA,NA

Sometimes such data streams can be obtained automatically by high-throughput grid-based sensor devices, but in complex and dynamic environments it is frequently necessary to complement such sensor data with specific high-precision field observations. In the weObserve project we analyse exactly such combined data situations where citizen observers provide semantically rich but typically biased information directly from the field, and where this information needs to be jointly analysed together with large-scale low-resolution sensor data. We address all individual steps of a suitable information processing pipeline ranging from data collection - where we focus on novel devices and apps for citizen scientists - to data integration - with all its associated problems of dealing with heterogeneous data records that differ in resolution, in reliability, precision and coverage - to data analysis - where we develop novel machine learning methods that can detect patterns in Big Data and exploit such patterns for making predictions. We evaluate this new processing pipeline in two carefully selected applications with complementary requirements and different ways to gather data.  Whilst the first application scenario concerns environmental monitoring in the context of solid degradation and landslides in Swiss Alpine regions, the second case study focuses on biodiversity monitoring with specific emphasis on radar-based detection of bird migration patterns in Switzerland and its neighbouring countries. Both applications have in common that high-throughput grid-based sensor information (areal photographs, radar signals etc.) have to be combined with high-precision observational data from citizen observers. We expect that intelligent data analysis will lead to new insights to soil degradation processes (including extreme events like landslides), and - in the second application - to a better understanding of bird migration patterns. Detailed knowledge about such migration patterns will be indispensable for developing monitoring and forecast systems which are particularly pertinent for flight safety, renewable energy and control of pests and diseases.; Soil degradation monitoring; Data analysis; Machine learning; Data collection; Biodiversity monitoring; Environmental monitoring; Citizen science; Data integration",4,1,Collaborative,3,1,More than one discipline,20500,30200,20700,NA,NA,NA

Despite these conspicuous advantages, ASSBs are still at research stage, leaving a substantial gap before practical adoption. Main challenge with ASSBs lies in their inferior rate performance and long-term cyclability, both primarily originating from the destabilization of electrode-electrolyte interface and the creation and propagation of mechanical stress. Energy density should also be carefully evaluated, and a well-known approach to compensate for it, is to use lithium (Li) metal anodes. Whereas individual state-of-the-art solid electrolytes offer high ionic conductivities enough for cell operation, once assembled, the cell performance is mostly not as good as expected, indicating the importance and challenge of particle-to-particle interface. Once electrolyte and active material particles are in contact, (electro-) chemical reactions take place leading to a space-charge effect build a lithium ion depleted layer, imposing a barrier for Li ion transport. The complexity of the problem necessitates an interdisciplinary research approach to tackle inferior cell performance of ASSBs and establish a fundamental understanding on the interface and morphology problems. In this direction, here, we propose a systematic strategy targeting the interface engineering of sulfide-based solid electrolytes (SEs), high voltage Ni-rich layered cathode active materials (CAMs) and Li-metal anodes. The choice of sulfide SEs arise from the consensus that sulfide SEs are suitable and a unique material for good interface contact due to their ductile mechanical properties and ability to be cold pressed. Our synergistic effort involves in-depth understanding of interfacial reactions guided by advanced diagnostics and machine-learning driven atomic scale modeling to achieve both thermodynamic and chemical stability through (1) Coskun group@UniFr, AC: the design and synthesis of elastic polymeric binders and surface stabilization of sulfide electrolytes and membrane coating on the Li-metal surface. (2) El Kazzi group@PSI, MEK: Surface and bulk operando analysis and characterization of electrochemical cells and the identification of interfacial reaction byproducts and intermediates (3) Ceriotti group@EPFL, MC: Structure, stability and reactivity of SE from machine-learning accelerated molecular simulations and (4) Choi group@SNU, JWC: the advanced electrochemical characterization of battery electrodes, optimization of cell conditions and testing battery electrodes at industrially relevant cell conditions. Accordingly, the specific five work packages (WPs) for the project involve (1) the development of solution-processed electrode coating using elastic binders and stabilization of SEs (AC) guided by machine learning (MC), (2) optimization of Ni-rich layered cathode active materials (JWC & MEK), (3) protection and interface optimization of Li-free anodes (AC, JWC), (4) characterization of electrodes using operando analytic tools (MEK, MC) and finally (5) demonstration of 2 Ah prototype cell (JWC, AC, MEK). Critically, the development of individual electrode components, machine learning and operando analyses will be intimately linked to identify interfacial issues and the solutions. In particular, the design for polymeric binders and electrolyte themselves as well as their interaction with active electrode materials will enable breakthroughs for the development of high performance ASSBs comparable to that of current LIBs.; Li-metal anode; Energy Storage ; Li-ion battery; Surface Functionalization; Polymeric Binders",4,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,NA,20500,20300,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, forest-land faces growing pressure, particularly in the plateau region of Switzerland and more specifically in agglomerations. The spread of settlement areas increasingly consumes precious agricultural land which intensifies demands to convert forest-land into agricultural or construction land. Renewable energy installations potentially claim surfaces in the woodlands; flood prevention and river restoration might also affect the forest area. Promoting wood as a substitute for other materials and the call for more regional value added chains might result in intensified harvesting and eased timber production. Hence, the potentially growing sectors of a sustainable economy are competing for ever more scarce land and in turn increase the pressure on the forests. This challenge facing a transition toward a sustainable economy is often overlooked in the public debate as well as in the scientific literature. ATREE thus pursues the following research questions: what are the trade-offs between different sectors of a sustainable economy from the perspective of the forest sector, and which policy instruments seem feasible for offsetting these? Which combination of policy instruments (policy mixes) are acceptable to existing actor coalitions in a given region in Switzerland? And what are these policy mixes’ implications for expected land-use patterns?The proposal is organized in four work packages. The first serves to identify the legal framework conditions, detect current sustainable economy trade-offs and already employed solutions as well as to collect data on Swiss agglomerations. Based on this data, case study regions (agglomerations) will be selected for in-depth analyses in the subsequent work packages 2 and 3. Specifically, we will analyse the political feasibility of proposed policy mixes based on the identification of actor coalitions, networks and preferences regarding policy instruments in the selected case study agglomerations (WP 2). Based on this knowledge about the most feasible policy mix and additional knowledge about actor characteristics, we will simulate the land use outcomes applying agent-based modelling techniques. These models will produce maps of land use outcomes for our case study regions (WP 3). In the final work package, the underlying integrative policy mixes (including e.g. market-based instruments as well as planning measures) and the spatially explicit representations of their outcomes will be discussed and reflected on together with stakeholders and decision-makers in multiple workshops in the case study regions as well as in a final workshop including national and international actors. In sum, we aim to show which (simulated) policy mixes increase or decrease which sustainable economy trade-offs compared to the status quo and search for an optimal policy mix that minimizes all trade-offs.ATREE is organized as an inter-disciplinary project run by a team of researchers from WSL, HAFL and ETHZ that cover differing competences, ranging from political science to environmental economics. Moreover, we have identified research partners and collaborators from the public administration and other research institutes in Switzerland, Germany and Austria, in order to gain practice-relevance as well as insight from practices in neighbouring countries. Our target audiences are the scientific community and practitioners at different administrative levels: the Swiss Federal Administration, the administrations of the cantons and the municipalities. ; forest economy; land use planning; ecosystem services; agriculture; agglomeration; renewable energies; policy integration",3,1,Collaborative,2,1,More than one discipline,10600,10700,NA,NA,NA,NA

The work is a natural continuation of my doctoral thesis, involving the implementation, extension, and testing of the major ideas proposed within it to improve the fidelity and applicability of building simulation. I propose to carry out this work at the Energy Systems Research Unit (ESRU), in the University of Strathclyde, coding a new set of algorithms into the software ecosystem built around their cutting edge simulation kernel ESP-r (Clarke 2001). The work is divided into three work packages as follows:WP1 -- Implement the methods for calculating uncertainty in building simulation developed in my thesis into an uncertainty analysis test-bed. This test-bed would be a suite of inter-operable algorithms for use with BPSsoftware.WP2 -- Apply the developments in new contexts, extending and testing the algorithms beyond the evaluation of individual buildings to include modelling of neighbourhoods, energy grids, estates, and other collections of building systems.WP3 -- Use the emulator and synthetic weather data to create a module for the stochastic optimisation of building systems.The project is structured around developing and implementing novel techniques and algorithms for the benefit of the building simulation community. In keeping with the philosophy and guidelines of the NSF, and those of ESRU, these ‘modules’, stand-alone source code compatible with the most common BPS software and data formats, will be Open Source and freely distributed.
